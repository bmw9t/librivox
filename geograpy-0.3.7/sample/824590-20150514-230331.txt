Quote:If it is too much, they shouldn't be BCing. The BC job comes with more responsibility and the BC must be able to do the job. (Or have a co-BC who can do it). This is why we ask that BC's are experienced before they coordinate a book.True, but we all know that newbie BCs (even when they've been around a long time) still need a bit of extra support
