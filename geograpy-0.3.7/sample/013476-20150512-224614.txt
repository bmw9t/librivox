Hi!My name is Will.  I live in the quaint New England village of Pawtuxet in Rhode Island.  I found out about Librivox when searching for free audiobooks to listen to while I was laid up in bed recovering from an illness.  I've listened to several books so far with great satisfaction, and look forward to recording perhaps  a book or two!
