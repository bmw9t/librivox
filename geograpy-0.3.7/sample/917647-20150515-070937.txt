Hahaha!

UCSD is the University of California at San Diego, and I'll be there as a Literature/Classical Linguistics major.  My first choice is UCLA (Univ. California Los Angeles), since I already live in L.A. and would prefer not to move, but UCSD is my second choice.

Mostly at this point, I am just relieved to have gotten in anywhere -- with a six-month waiting period for admission decisions, I was beginning to get a little anxious.
