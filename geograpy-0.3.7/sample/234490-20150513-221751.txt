hello MrParracts,Welcome to librivox. I am glad that you find this novel interesting and  I see that you have already chosen the sections of your choice, However, you need to first complete the 1-min test recording and you can have the sections you want once you get a OK-pass for your recording.Follow this URL http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/Newbie_Guide_to_Recording ; and submit your 1-min test recording in the listeners wanted thread and you would get a response in say about a day or so and then you can start recording the sections.
