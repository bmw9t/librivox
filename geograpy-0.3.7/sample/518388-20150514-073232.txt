Hi Anne,

The story is “Way of a Rebel” by Walter M. Miller Jr.  It was originally published in the magazine  _If_   in 1954 I believe.  It may be the worst Miller story I've ever read.  I'm a big fan of his, though, so here's to getting his name out there.

This is my first submission to this collection.  Would you please file this under the name Joseph Lawler.
