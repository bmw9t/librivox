I hoped I'd see you here Gord.    I saw that you were one of the ones discussing it in the suggested books forum.  And who better than the reader known as "The Voice" could I hope for to read "The Tiger"?!  I look forward to it, and by all means grab more if you have more time later and there are still some available.
