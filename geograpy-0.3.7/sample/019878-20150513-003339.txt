My name is Jessica.  I am a stay at home mother with a love for classic novels.  I discovered LibriVox while looking for an app on my Iphone to play free audio books.  After listening to at least 10 of them, I have decided to try my hand at it, to give others the opportunity to hear great books.  I hope to get started soon.

Best Wishes,
