And that the narrator has not been PLed yet for anything after that?No, Chauvelin and the narrator have been corrected and Chapter 2 is good to go.Chapter 4 is also ready to go.The narration for Chapter 3 needs some corrections, but I don't think it will be far away.Please note, Bob very thoughtfully leaves 10 seconds of silence at the end of each chapter. If the final version is less than 30 minutes long (as I think it will be for most chapters) we can cut this down to five.
