I had to change my forum password earlier today too.  I bet it is the mandatory password change for security purposes that we put off for a month, now coming around again.  We'll find out soon enough, if other people have to do it too (it is possible it was just some glitch for Kirsten and me).Kirsten, if you go to login and click the thing that says "I forgot my password," it should send you a new one automatically.  Log in using that, then go to your User Control Panel -- Profile -- Edit Account Settings to change it to something you can remember more easily.  If you haven't posted here in the next 24 hrs, I will assume that it didn't work and contact you by email with the next step.edited to add:  Wait a minute -- you can post here but not in the LP?  Is it the MW password as Anne thought, or the forum one?
