Carl,

Hi there, and welcome!  3 is yours - I'll mark it 'claimed' in a second.

As this'll be your first recroding, can you have a read through the Newbie Guide to Recording, if you haven't already.  

And as these are such long chapters, it's be an idea to first submit a short recording - a paragraph or so - just to make sure you've got the technical side of things all OK before you invest a lot of time.  

Finally, at some point can you let me know how you'd like to be credited in the catalogue, and if you have a URL to link to?  I'll enter that on our list of readers, so you won't be asked again for other books.

Enjoy recording!

David
