My advice is that it's much better to read to the end, then go back and edit out the flubs.  You get a more consistent and natural sound that way. 

When you find you've mis-read something, pause, then start again from the beginning of the phrase or sentence, trying to keep the same tone etc.

Then when you go back to edit the recording, the mistakes are easily edited out, because you're taking out a whole phrase.

But, to answer your question.... If you do stop and re-start recording, you may need to make the Audacity window bigger.  When you re-start recording, it adds a new audio track below the first one; if your window is too small (top-to-bottom), you can't see the new track.
