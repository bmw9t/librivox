due to my short attention span and financial resources when I was in college, I did a lot of miniature quilts... even had two of them featured in Miniature Quilts Magazine (one even won an award) ... I've also made to-scale dollhouse quilts with machine strip-piecing techniques and hand quilting... very satisifying as they are so small that completion is easier than the large projects I've attempted (and almost always not completed) ... ahhh maybe now that I have a sewing room again, I'll get back into quilting =)
