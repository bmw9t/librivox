Hi Walt,Sorry for the delay in getting to this one. RL intruded during the week.   Just a couple missing phrases/sentences (in red below) in this one. Otherwise the section was fine.   37:46 - missing phrase:I listened to the rumbling of the gunning away in the salient, and seemed to hear the groans of men at Hooge, at St.-Eloi, in other awful places.52:15 - missing sentence:"Ce n'est pas bon du tout, du tout!" ("It is not good at all, at all!") The captain clapped him on the shoulders, tried to cheer him.Thanks,Don
