OK. It'll be done.Another question on a broader topic...The Augusburg Confession is one of 11 documents in "The Christian Book of Concord" (1580). One of the documents has been previously recorded on Librivox (The Large Catechism) and I am thinking about proposing and volunteering for another (The Smalcald Articles) after this project is done.  Do you think it would be worthwhile for me to make a book suggestion to complete the other 8 docs and bundle them all together? Or is that pretty difficult after some have already been done independantly of the others?Jon
