Hi Ezwa,

Thanks for replying, I'm glad to have an MC 

As for your questions: 
    * do you have server space to hold the files? If not, can you ftp ?
I am not sure. I don't have server space myself, but my dad has. I need to ask him how much he has, and if I'll be able to borrow space there.  I'll get back to you on that asap. Otherwise I should be able to ftp.
    * your catalogue name is the same as the one you give in the disclaimer, isn't it ?
Maria Elmvang? Yup, it is.
    * did you write the summary ?
Yes, I did.

PS : BTW, have you read this : How to Become a Book Coordinator ?
Yes, I did before volunteering. I wanted to make sure I didn't sign up for more than I could cope with
