(Not that there's anything stopping anyone from putting it on eBay after removing the disclaimers - PD is PD is PD. I would personally feel more cordially towards an eBay seller who gave LV credit and didn't go out of his way to disguise the fact that the recordings are freely available, but it has no effect other than on our feelings.)
