Thought I would introduce myself.  I've known about this site for some time but haven't taken the time to volunteer to help - though I have wanted to.  I just finished my graduate degree in Library and Information Studies.

I am now living in rural Alberta, Canada and working as a Training and Development Librarian for a regional library system.  I recently did a write up of LibriVox on my work blog - www.nlls.ab.ca/InformationOverload

I have a couple titles that I am very interested in recording.  I see that I should begin by recording some book chapters or perhaps poetry to start.  This is probably a good idea since i am a little self-concious about wether I have the voice for a solo project - no matter how much I long to do it.

Once I record something I hope I'll get an honest opinion of how it sounds before it goes live - or I attempt a solo project. 

Well I'm glad to be a part of the community - If you'll have me.

Thanks
