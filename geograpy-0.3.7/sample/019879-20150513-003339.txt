Welcome, Jessica!

All the information you need to get started can be found on the wiki. Here is the link: http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/Newb ... _Recording. 

You are encouraged to record a one-minute test to check your technical settings. It's not an audition, but to make sure you're exporting at the correct bit rate, have your recording in mono, etc. 

There are lots of projects looking for readers. You can also get your feet wet by reading a short story or poem for one of these: 

Short Poetry Collection:  http://librivox.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=27926
Children's Short Works:  http://librivox.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=26896

Those are just examples. There's a lot to do here!
