Hi Leni --

I'll be recording chapter ten, section one tomorrow. Before I do, I have a couple of questions:

1. Do you want us to read the bracketed portions of the translation? Since it's a type of in-text footnoting (for clarification, it seems), I wasn't sure if I should read it with the bracketed words left in or not. Either way is fine. Just let me know your preference.

2. For "viz." and "i.e." -- would you prefer I read "viz" and "i.e." as written, or substitute English versions of these terms, such as "namely" or "which is to say"? Again, I don't mind either way, just wondering if you have a preference or if other readers of this book have already set a precedent.

Looking forward to recording tomorrow!
