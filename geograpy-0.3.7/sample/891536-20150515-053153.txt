One theory I read suggested that O2 were deliberately overblocking (they'd blocked Cbeebies!)  The British Library and BBC were also blocked of the ones I checked myself yesterday after seeing Childline was out.  The idea being that if people do blindly opt for all blocks, there's only a tiny amount of the internet remaining usable -- and so people realise there's more to the problem than just turning everything off.  I think that's perhaps wishful thinking, but hoping for the best anyway.
