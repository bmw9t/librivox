Rachel,

Thanks a lot for the encouragement and understanding.  I think I'm over the shock and ready to stay with it.  I have thought more about mixing other stuff in, and I think I may start the recording I'd hoped to do for Christmas gifts.  

I want to record Ralph Moody's Little Britches (maybe the series over time) for my family, only, since it's a huge favorite, but it's not in the public domain.  Maybe some shorts from James Herriot.  Maybe a little Laura Ingalls Wilder - again all for family, only, since they are classics we've all enjoyed with our children.  And maybe some poetry for Librivox, to mix things up a bit.  (I wonder if there's a thread here for favorite reading that isn't in the public domain - a list for us "Voxers" to share with one another.)  I'm wishing I could afford MP3 players for everyone on my Christmas list so I could deliver my gifts that way.

And I've slowed my DD pace.  Instead of both recording and editing a chapter at a time, I'm recording one day, coming back the next time to edit.  That really helps - especially with these hour-long chapters.

Thanks again!
