Thanks for the reply Todd!I'm willing to bet your Sony makes much better recordings than my RCA, judging by the price difference on amazon.Here's an uncleaned 1 minute test I did with it earlier this week so you can judge for yourself -> http://upload.librivox.org/share/uploads/tests/test_erfunden3.mp3It actually doesn't sound too bad to my ears.  Just picks up alot more room noise than I might like.  Maybe if I can improvise a stand for it and a vocal booth (like this one: http://www.instructables.com/id/Portable-Mini-Vocal-Booth/) it might be usable.
