It should say on the Gutenberg main page for each book "Not copyrighted in the US" -- always check, because there are a few copyrighted things on Gutenberg.  So your examples are most likely fine for US readers but may not be OK for readers in other countries.

edited to add:  I don't know how a 1970's book could possibly be public domain even in the US (unless explicitly placed in the PD by the author and publisher)... but I don't know the intricacies of copyright law.
