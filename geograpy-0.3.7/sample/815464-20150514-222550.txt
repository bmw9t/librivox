1. Published before 1923 anywhere in the world makes it A-OK for us. 2. We currently have 3 versions of "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes" in our catalog. This may show that we're OK with multiple versions.  Whether others have the work as an audiobook makes absolutely no difference to us.3. If you only want to record a couple stories out of the work, I'd suggest submitting them to the Short Story Collection. That way you don't have to record the whole book or find others to record the sections you'd rather not do. Here's a link to the current collection: viewtopic.php?f=19&t=50028 Be sure to read the instructions in the first post. Have fun!
