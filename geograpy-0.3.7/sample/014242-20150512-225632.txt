Hi Sandra!  I'm with your kids - I think you're great!     Really, you don't have to be great - that's one of the great things about LV.  But you get better with practice!  Your kids'll get a kick out of hearing you on the computer, or the iPod, I bet.I'll put some links down here that should help you get started recording.  The files we make do have to be in a certain format: mp3, mono, 44,100Hz, 16-bit, 128kbps and usually louder than most people think!  Here's the Newbie Guide to Recording:  Newbie Guide to Recording.  And we respectfully urge a 1 Minute Test, to help you get things all set up!  Here's a link that explains how to do that: 1-Minute Test Recording:  1-Minute Test.  You would upload your test and then post the link to the test as a new thread in the Listeners Wanted Forum.  Instructions are in the link, including where to upload the link, the username and the password to use, etc.This test is not for any kind of audition purposes, just to make sure that it fits our format technically and that your levels are okay.  People here are very helpful and friendly, so don't be afraid to ask any questions you have along the way.  You can just ask away in this same thread if you have any trouble.Have fun!Samanem
