I will create articles when I feel qualified to do so.  I wish I had been able to see links to Audio versions of books/stories I viewed on Wikipedia.  I cannot go to sleep without listening to something and I may never watch TV again after listening to TV for so loooong!I found my way here (Internet Archive) entirely round-a-bout.  [adding an external editor to Wikipedia!] otherwise I wouldn't have known so many audio recordings were available free of charge [I can't afford the $20+ I see at Amazon, eBay, where ever]I don't want to waste my time or get in a snit with anyone at Wikipedia.Thanks for any thoughts, I will keep in mind what was already posted.Jen   I'm all for it - would be great if you could work on adding more links, Jen - and perhaps reach even more listeners who haven't heard of us before.
