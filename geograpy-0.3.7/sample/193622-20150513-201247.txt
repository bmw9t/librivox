Chapter 4 is on its way soon  Hi, P.J.--very nice job!  I have no notes on the reading of the text itself, but we have a few "technical" things to correct.Section 03:--At ~4:50 we have nearly 24 seconds of silence.  Could you please cut this down to a more typical silence between paragraphs, please?--We need 5 seconds of silence at the end of the recording (10 seconds only if the recording is longer than 30 minutes), so please reduce some of the ending silence.--The volume comes in at 91.3 dB, so just barely on the top edge of our acceptable range.  But since you will be uploading another time anyway, you might amplify by -2.0 to bring it down closer to our goal of 89 dB.Upload the file using the same file name, post here in the this thread along with the new length of the track--and I'll take another quick look.  Let me know if you have any questions--and thanks!(And these recordings always take longer than one imagines that they will--at least, somehow it still takes me forever to record/edit.  )Oops, sorry about that! This is what happens when I do these things in the middle of the night Here's Chapter 3 again, minus the awkward pause, with 5 seconds of silence at the end, and coming in at 89.4 DB: https://librivox.org/uploads/dii/bookofcats_03_ross_128kb.mp3It's now 23:15.49.Here also is Chapter 4, hopefully without any of the aforementioned issues! https://librivox.org/uploads/dii/bookofcats_04_ross_128kb.mp3It is 19:42.69.Let me know if I need to make any more edits. Thanks!
