Since you are the BC, it is your call.  Some people read them, some don't.  If it is felt they are not really needed or interrupt the flow too much, they are usually skipped.  If you wish to read them, I would read footnote 1 right where it is and footnote 2 right after the word "candle".  Always start a footnote saying "Footnote", then read the footnote, and then say "End footnote" and then continue on; don't read the actual number of the footnote (i.e., 1 or 2).
