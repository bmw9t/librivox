I vote the same as David.
It all depends upon the content.
If you listen through and and some bits seem to drag on a bit then you get the scissors out and chop it.
If you're enjoying listening to it then you let it go on.
I felt that way with your mobile recording unit review.
It was entertaining and interesting and so I let it run through with only minor interruptions.
If it's fun I will listen for hours - it's a podcast after all so you can stop and start it up again whenever you wish.
The regular podcast has to be whatever the podcaster has time for as well as what's entertaining. 
Sometimes if there isn't much in the way of material I'm happy for it to be just a few minutes long. I never try to pad it out.
That way boredom lies for the podcaster as well as the listener.
