Bowel you have areally tiny spike?   I will listen to the files again and see what I can find A spike in Audacity - let me try to define it (I'm really bad with defining words!  ) - like a waveform that is really tall...Most times you can hear them, but sometimes (like the one I was mentioning) you can't. If you can hear it, yes, you want to get rid of it somehow. If you can't then - well, do what you like! Spikes - just look for them! It won't be that hard to see. When you look at waveforms, if you see a really small, tall one (if that makes sense!) that doesn't seem to belong, listen to it. If it doesn't sound right being there, then get rid of it by whatever means you like as long as it doesn't leave 'undesirable consequences'. I hope I made sense here - I was trying to say something real quick before I started sorting/packing some of the books! Oh, I hope I don't have to get rid of any of them! Books are my friends!
