Here is what I posted in the initial post of this form regarding those sections: Note About "The Deceitful Marriage" and "Dialogue Between Scipio and Berganze": Since "Dialogue" is written as a true dialogue, it will be read by two readers. Each will read their lines as we do for recordings of dramatic works. This story is interwoven with "The Deceitful Marriage" as well. The reader who reads "The Deceitful Marriage" will also be recording the final paragraphs of "Dialogue". Each text link in the Magic Window describes exactly what you should record. If you are interested in reading "The Deceitful Marriage," I will PM you more explicit instructions on how you should record the end of "Dialogue" as a separate file. Denny: Please upload your file as exemplarynovels_scipio_cervantes.mp3. Reader of the end of "Dialogue": Please upload that file as exemplarynovels_addendum_cervantes.mp3. As always, if you have any questions at all, please feel free to post them in the forum or send by PM. 

So...in other words, don't worry about that text link. You will not need to PL that portion until after I've inserted it in its appropriate place at the end of section 11. I'll be PLing section 10 myself, and won't post the final product for PLing into the magic window until I've done so.  I know it's confusing, but pretty much, don't worry about the second text link of section 09, or anything from section 10 or 11 until just before we're ready to catalog the book. PM me if you have any questions.

Thanks again.
