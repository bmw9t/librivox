How does this look, I've not actually written a summary yet.  Proofing would be helpful.  Punctuation is the bane of my existance. (As is spelling, oh, and grammar too. )


“I'd tasted blood, and it was all over with me.  Why should I work when I could steal?  Why settle down to some humdrum uncongenial billet, when excitement, romance, danger and a decent living were all going begging together?” - A. J. Raffles, The Ides of March.

The Amateur Cracksman is the first collection of stories about A. J. Raffles, gentleman, cricketer and thief.  After stopping his old school friend, Bunny Manders, from a desperate attempt at suicide, Raffles introduces the unsuspecting Bunny to a new way of earning a living, burglary.  Though frequently horrified by Raffles actions, the conscience stricken Bunny stands by him through all their adventures, firm to his promise, “When you want me, I'm your man!”
