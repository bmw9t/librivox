Of course this is just a loose observation but the aloud-ability seems to be vastly separate from a books read-ability. Maybe there could be LibriVox Notes, a public domain version of Spark Notes (tm)?slightly off topicIf you look at your history during most of the 19th century books were read aloud. There was an enormous amount of hand sewing etc done in the pre machine age by all classes and either one of the group would read aloud or in the evenings the man would read aloud while the wife mended the sheets and his shirts and sewed the children's clothes etc. Anne
