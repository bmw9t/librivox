Here's one possible way to group them:01 - The Dude and His Pajamas, The Boers and the Filipinos; The Soldier with Iron Spoon and Branding Iron02 - "Admiral, Is My Hat on Straight?"; Gave the Prisoner Rope; The Trust and the DrummerIntro would be:Quote:"Section 2 of Sumbeams by George W. Peck.. This LibriVox recording is in the Public Domain. Recording by [your name]. Section 1.  "Admiral, Is My Hat on Straight?."Then when you get to the end of that story, you read the title of the next story and continue reading, like you were reading through the book.  At the end of the section you say:  End of Section 2.MaryAnnI think we were posting at the same time! Thank you so much for taking this project on! We will try not to be too difficult! (though I guess I shouldn't speak for my parents! but I will anyway!   )I see what you mean about the intro's, I think! That would certainly be less awkward, if we didn't need to list each piece at the beginning of the reading, but could give the titles as we went. And I Love the shortened Introduction!My dad is taking the lead in this one, so I'll leave it to him to decide how to arrange the sections, but I just wanted to thank you so much for being our MC!!!!
