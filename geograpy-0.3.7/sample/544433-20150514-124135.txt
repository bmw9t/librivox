One question about the intro and closing of these chapters:

Instead of saying at the beginning of a chapter. "Chapter 7 of the Whole Family. . . . . . . recording by . . . . 
    * Say:
      "The Whole Family, by Author. [Chapter]" 

wouldn't it make more sense to say something like

The Whole Family, Chapter 7, by Henry James (rather than The Whole Family, by Henry James, Chapter 7.) 

But I'll do whatever fits.
