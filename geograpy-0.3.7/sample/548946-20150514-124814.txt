Yes we do!  At least from you!  I hope you will consider reading Mansfield Park also?  I love listening to your recordings!  Thank you for your time...and getting me through some rough days at work...I come home to listen to your recordings and I am soon rejuvenated to go back another day.  I really appreciate your expression and voices that carries me away to another time and place.  Much better than a movie!  Thanks again!
