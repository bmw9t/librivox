Welcome to LibriVox, DannyHauger! Here in Librivox, we do all project-related chat in the open forums. We do not deal with it through PMs or emails. I saw you have requested the same thing in other projects, so, just letting you know.A great way to get to know how things work here in Librivox is reading this wiki article: http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/How_LibriVox_Works. The ins tructions for where to upload are in the first post of the project (as it also is in every first post of every project).I'll be glad to assign you section seven, but I need to know under what name/pseudonym you'd like to appear in the catalog. I'd also strongly recommend that you record your 1-minute test first just in case there are any technical issues to work out. You can read all about it here: http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/1-Minute_TestThanks!
