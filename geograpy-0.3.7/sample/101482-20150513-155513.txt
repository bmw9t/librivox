Sorry! I just noticed I said "Section 58" before. I meant "Section 57" which I listened to first. So the notes above are for Section 57.I did Section 58 just now, and it's PL OK. That is, there were a few repetitions, like 4-5 not more, but I thought it easier this time to just listen in Audacity and cut out the repeats on the spot instead of noting the time and text. The volume was nice in this section. I hope you don't mind, Kristin! I've reuploaded, and re-downloaded to check that the upload went through and all OK!
