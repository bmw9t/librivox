Great Michele.  Why don't you go ahead and post in Listeners Wanted.  If you haven't done that before, there's a template in the "Read this before posting" sticky note at the top.  An MC will be along to make your post sticky (so it stays at the top until we get a DPL) and to freeze it (so that no one can post there, they have to come here to post).MaryAnn
