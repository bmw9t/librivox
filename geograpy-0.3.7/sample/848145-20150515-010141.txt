Praise for Priya (Priya, India) via the 'Thank a reader' feature:Quote:Priya,I am about half way through listening to the book, but I wanted to stop and say thank you for your reading of the Bhavagad gita, chapter 3 on Librivox.  I thought your  reading was spectacular and I find myself wishing you had done all the chapters.  It is such a bonus hearing the book read in the accent of the culture with which it is associated.  Your reading is done with such meaning and feeling that the listener really can get a sense of that conversation between Arjuna and Krishna.  Especially when  you get to parts where Krishna exhorts Arjuna to “fight”;  the way you expressed it just fascinated me;  so much so that I had to take a moment and write and offer my gratitude for your contribution.  The energy you put into the reading shines through. J The light in me honors and blesses the light in you,DJThe Bhagavad GhitaAll of Priya's recordings
