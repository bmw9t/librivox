Hmm, interesting, looks like I missed most of this.  Poetry and especially weekly poetry are my favorite part of LV because of all the different renditions and voices you get.  I love hearing one poem read by x number of voices in x number of ways - it makes me hear different things and get more out of the text.  

And I'm of Hugh's camp, I tend to prefer the straightforward readings to the showy dramatic ones.  If I wanted super dramatic readings, I'd be buying professional recordings.  But I like feeling like a normal person is reading to me.  To each his own, I suppose, but it certainly is not the way of LibriVox to try to impose your preferences on others or give unsolicited advice.
