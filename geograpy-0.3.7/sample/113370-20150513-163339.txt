 So why am I trolling around the Senior Projects?  I'm close to completing the load of sections i (over)committed to so I can start some of my solo projects, and said I wouldn't take on anything else for awhile.I've seen this on the list, but never really looked at it.  Probably there is a whole lot here that is outdated scientifically and conclusions that I wouldn't agree with, but I see some fun chapters.  Fun sometimes trumps a lot of other stuff.So, If you could put me in for SECTIONS 32 and 33, I'll have some variety to add to my reading.   And no jokes about why i want to read about parasites . . . my interest is purely scientific.    ~Larry (silverquill)
