I had no idea at all that this project, improving Wikipedia's LibriVox page, would cause such problems or raise so many emotions. It is all very disappointing to me. I still think the Wikipedia page could be improved and should be improved and still intend to do it myself even at the risk of condemnation here at LibriVox.If you folks feel that if I proceed with this plan that I should no longer be involved in LibriVox you need to tell me. Otherwise I shall continue as I have, OK?
