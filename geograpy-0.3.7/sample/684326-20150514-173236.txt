Hee hee, I am running my operating system off a 40 gig hard drive and have a slave of 80 gig and I have to be careful to delete files once they are in the catalogue.

One of my former housemates had a hideously ancient computer (for school) with a three gig hard drive.  I have no idea how she survived.

And yes, I am seriously considering getting an external drive. For now, though, once I'm done a recording I keep only the MP3 file, because those Audacity project files take up a LOT of space. I wish my hard drive was like the TARDIS -- bigger on the inside.
