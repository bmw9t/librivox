The new text is kind of echo-ee, not sure why.  Sounds OK as a footnote, but not so much for the repaired text at 11:34.  Sorry I missed the footnote in the first place.  It would have been easier to fit it in more smoothly if it was done as part of the original recording.Sounds great to me.  Thanks for the fix, no worry about missing the footnote.  Section 1 is PL OK.  Thanks much!Jill
