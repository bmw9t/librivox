I should note, for Windows folks with swisher computers than me, that Captivate has a free 30 day trial, so if you just want to goof around for a month, and then get back to Real Work, that might well be perfect.  Can vouch for the super sound quality, and it didn't seem any more complicated than Wink to twiddle about ... possibly easier!
