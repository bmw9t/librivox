I don't think there's a hard and fast rule, but really the purpose of the very beginning of the intro is for listeners to quickly know that they've got the right section.  So my vote would be for using your own section divisions to say "Section XX of Handbook of Nature Study", then the LV disclaimer, then whatever long-ish title there is to describe the section.  In this long-ish part, I might include the Part # and Chapter # only in the first relevant section, but that's up to you.  For the outro, I'd say "End of section XX."  Again, so they can quickly hear "end of section 21.", "section 22 of..." and know they're in the right place.
