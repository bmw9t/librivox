Thank you CM and Jim (and you too Hugh) for your suggetstions and comments on the themes. 

Well, at one time, I knew how to put stuff on Archive.org, and I had a log in to the Wiki, but I had forgotten all of that!! Thanks for updating it for me. 

I have a full little computer-based studio in my office.  The first three themes were all "virtual" instruments (which are really just samples of real instruments - you can get pretty real sounding with the right technique, voicings, effects, production, etc).  The last one was a mike of me actually playing my real nylon guitar.  I added a few effects to make it sound like I am in a cathedral!

OK, a muted guitar (electric I presume), and a jazz version somewhere between free and smooth coming up soon (which is all relative, given my schedule).
