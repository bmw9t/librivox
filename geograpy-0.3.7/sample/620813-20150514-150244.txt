Troy – I know enough not to define “science fiction” with any specificity. However I believe “Dead World” qualifies. It was published in Amazing Stories (an SF magazine), and it was written by Jack Douglas (an SF writer).

Personally I go by Asimov’s definition: It must contain at least one speculative idea, and that idea must be integral to the plot. So for example, “Flowers for Algernon” is SF even though the nuts and bolts of the experimental operation are not detailed in the story. If you take the surgical operation away, the story can’t be told. On the other hand “Star Wars” is not SF because you could take all the characters, trade their light sabers for 6-guns, put them on horseback and tell the same story as a western. 

But the bottom line is; if you think it’s SF that’s probably good enough for me. So welcome to Librivox, upload your story, and I will make sure it finds a home in these collections…

Thanks;
