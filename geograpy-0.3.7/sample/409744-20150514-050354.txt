Go to Tracks / Add New / Audio Track. I assume you'd have to then paste the reference track into the new track you made.If you can, I suggest recording yours while listening to the other one. It's amazing how much phrasing is different between individuals - some words are longer than others, and that's harder to match up than just editing silences. But any little bit helps!
