Hi, sorry if this question has been asked before, I did a quick skim but couldn't find it. I've done a few recordings and listened to them back and realised that I made quite a few stumbles that I didn't correct at the time. I've tried rerecording the sentences in which I stumbled, but now it sounds completely different, e.g. different sound quality, voice pitch tone, etc, and it's totally obvious that I've made corrections. It's not the way I read it, but the recording itself. I've tried different rooms in my house, saying it differently and different distance from the mike, but I just can't figure out how to make the recording sound the same. Is there a way I can fix this in Audacity? Or would someone else be able to fix it for me? Help! It was a really long recording and took me forever, I really don't want to have to do the whole thing over again!Thanks in advance, Corinne
