Hi Stephanie!

Downloading! 

Edit: I just listened to a short bit. (Will be back with proper PL notes soon) The quality of your new mic is really good. It makes your voice sound clearer. 
I only very rarely heard a clicking in the background, but it's barely noticeable and certainly doesn't interfere with your reading. (I never particularly noticed any clicking with your old mic either...)
