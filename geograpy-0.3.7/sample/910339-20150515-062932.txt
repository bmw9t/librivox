Thanks.  I do like swashbucklers, and, since I read Scaramouche
in high school, I'd like to see this movie version.  It has a good
cast in addition to Granger.  Unfortunately, our public library
doesn't have it.  However, I have the ear of the librarian who 
does the DVD purchasing so there is hope.
