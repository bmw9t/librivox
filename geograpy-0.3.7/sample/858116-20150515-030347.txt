I would agree with Kaffen here, with regards to poetry needing more pre-reading ... and with the ability to detect on the spot mishaps in reading, for immediate correction.

But I find that reading dramatic parts requires even more pre-reading and before the pre-reading, research, sometimes extensive, to get the character right.  I would say that my readings of Brutus (Julius Caesar), Laertes (Hamlet) and Kent (King Lear) took the most time of anything I've read for LV (even though between them, they add up to 30 minutes recording) ... what with all the researching, studying the whole play, even renting movies!  

I couldn't have done Brutus without James Mason's brilliant portrayal, opposite Marlon Brando (Antony) and John Gielgud (Cassius) to guide my reading.

At another end of the spectrum, there was no way to read the US Army Corps of Engineers survey of the damage at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, except with a "cold read."   I think more of the horrific nature of the events came off in my voice as a result.

Surprisingly, children's literature, though usually short, requires a lot of preparation.  Everything is in the tone ...
