I think what you're doing is fine, but you'll want to check with the BC or soloist to be certain, since you ARE going above/beyond standard PL. (Personally, I think standard could be changed to allow - perhaps not require - what you're talking about, but it's not all up to me.)Some soloists like word-perfect PL. I think some newbie soloists choose it because they don't realize that they can ask for "changes that affect the meaning" special PL. Once they're told the option, they usually go for that. I've seen legitimate WP PL on things like sacred texts (the Bible and scriptures of other religions) or technical texts.
