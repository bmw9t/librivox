We always read it as it was written.    I don't speak Dutch myself, but with English, I find it's lovely to hear older-style language, which sounds quaint, and conveys something of the history of the language, as well as directly connecting us with those old minds.  There's a place for modernising things but I'm very happy that at LibriVox, we record as-is.It's good that people COULD use LibriVox as a language learning resource, but it's not the only use for our books, and I'd be sad if we changed to producing books only with that in mind.  Very few learners would be using *just* our books to pick up a language, since there are so many other resources online, so I don't think there'll be a problem with hapless foreigners wandering around the Netherlands addressing people as thee and thou.   I think the key is to have AS MANY BOOKS AS POSSIBLE available!  If someone only used Shakespeare to learn English, they would sound rather odd on the modern High Street.  But the availability in our catalogue of Eliot, Wharton, bits of Woolf, Austen of course, and so on, rounds out a listener's language knowledge.  Clearly, we need many more Dutch books too.
