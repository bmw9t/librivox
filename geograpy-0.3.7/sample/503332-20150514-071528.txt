Am I allowed to say the city where I recorded, and do I have to say my real/full name?Here is the test; I made two textual errors and I think I prefer the other pronunciation of "octavo" but otherwise I hope it's OK.  Thanks and let me know!http://upload.librivox.org/share/upload ... _scott.mp3

Hi!

Your technical setting are all OK, the only thing you should fix is the volume which is a little low. Check your mic's input level and turn it up if you can, or if it's already turned up, you can amplify your recording.
You also have a few clicks, it would be great if you edited them out 

As for the name, you can use whatever name you want. Full name, forum name, nick name... In the intro you only say your name, but at the end you can say date, city etc. It's in my first post 
Is it OK if I add Kathryn Lois as your catalogue name?
