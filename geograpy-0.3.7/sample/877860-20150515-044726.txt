I'm trying to upload a test file, but I keep getting the following message:Code:undefined       Error The filetype you are attempting to upload is not allowed.I've tried Firefox, Safari, and Chrome on OSX, but they all give the same error.  The file in question is an mp3 that I've exported from Audacity.  It goes through the checker without any errors, and I've tried exporting it with both available sets of ID3 tags (v1 & v2) to no avail.  Any suggestions?
