You have made a number of suggestions , which do you thing is the most important ?AnneStrabo's Geography, like Ptolemy' are very important sources of information on ancient peoples, places, etc. My suggested books should appeal to anyone interested in ancient history or classical studies. I've noticed Flavius Josephus is in the catalog, well Philo was a contemporary of Josephus and his works provide an insight into the lives of Alexandria's Jewish and Greek communities. Which one do I think is the most important? Tough to say because they are all important. But if I had to pick one to do now, I go with Polybius. I love reading about Hannibal, one of the few generals whom the Romans really feared.Hmm, it seems like your resident classicist is Leni, so perhaps it is up to him/her to make the choice.
