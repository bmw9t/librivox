Hokuspokus wrote:European books enter the public domain 95 years after the first publication. Radetzkymarsch will be pd in 2028.Aha! So there is a fundamental and easily understood rule regarding European books. I think that partially makes up for the fact that Radetzkymarsch isn't available for LV. It's also nice to know that Balduin Groller's Dagobert Trostler stories (originally published as Detektiv Dagoberts Taten und Abenteuer, 1910-1912, followed up by Neue Detektivgeschichten in 1914) are in the public domain, providing someone can find a source text and upload it. The Rivals of Sherlock Holmes series piqued my interest in Groller's detective, but sadly most of his work isn't available in English, and certainly none prior to 1923.
