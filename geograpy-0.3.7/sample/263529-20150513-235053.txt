I'm deeply sorry! Especially, because it is a wonderful reading!    Only one tiny technical detail should be fixed. Recordings not longer than 30 minutes need 5 seconds of silence at the end, this recording has 2 seconds. Could you add 3 seconds of silence?Leni wrote:Hi, SteveThanks for the recording! Our wonderful PLer, kajo, will be around soon to give you some feedback.   Oh oh oh, I know, I lost this rating 4 weeks ago in too many projects. I'm so so sorry. It looks very promising at the moment that I can find my way back to my old pl shape.
