An Italian Dinner  By Mrs. W. G. Waters, from THE COOK'S DECAMERON

Menu:
Neapolitan Soup
Ostriche alla Livornese
Pollo all'Oliva 
Cauliflower alla Parmigiana
Polenta Pasticciata
Bodino of Semolina

Didn't realize as I was compiling this but it's a 'white' meal, i.e. oysters, chicken, cauliflower, semolina.  I guess you would serve it on dark-color china with red wine!
