(sorry, my english is not so good) 

Hello, I'm really interested in this project, it may really help those that can't read or just prefer listening, but it seems that we have a few portuguese (br) readers.

I tried to find some text to start, but I found nothing in my language, only completed projects. I'm disposed to start some reading, but I need someone to help me, I'm still lost in this forum. I think my voice is fine and I can accept some suggestions.

I'm ready to start anything, just need some help.
