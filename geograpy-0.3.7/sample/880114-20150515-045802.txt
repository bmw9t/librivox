I think there's a problem with permissions; I was using the link to the Listener's FAQ found here, which gives you a link to this FAQ.  However,that 'You are not authorised to read this forum.'I've since found the Listener FAQ in the Listener/Editor forum, but thought y'all might like to know- maybe the template used was out of date or I really can't view that forum?
