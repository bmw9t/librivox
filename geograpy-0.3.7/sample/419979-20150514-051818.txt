Too bad you had to give it up, it seems like a really good book so far although maybe not as jovial as chapter 2 made it sound. I listened to chapter 1 and realized it could be very sad. Let's hope it has a happy ending. I'll probably do a number of chapters. I hate to see books unfinished. Unfortunately our summer is late this year so I won't be spending too much time indoors for the next few weeks. Good luck with Grad School.
