Hello, Tricia. Although I've read the very short line of the French chef ["Thank you very much," followed by polite laughter], I'm willing to do Lady Catherine and can promise she will not sound the least bit like the other character. Would you like me to record her part and post it for you -- and if you're not happy with it you can keep seeking another reader? Happy to help.Beverly
