Whenever I would try and move around the pieces they would cut into the end of the previous track. I kept losing audio. Anyways I have a giant mess right now. I'm really sorry but I don't have the time/technical knowledge to record something right now so I'll have to withdraw. I'm very sorry!! This is a shame since I actually did like the reading aloud. I just don't have more time to go through and try and fix my mess of a recording right now.Well that is a shame Cobbeec.  I'm sorry you have had so much trouble editing that section.  Most people switch to Audacity from Garage Band because it is so much easier working with our type of tracks.   When you have the time again please try another section and try watching some of the videos on how we do it at http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/Instructional_Videos.   I will put your sectin back into the pot for some one else and thanks for trying!
