Hi Zach,Welcome back!  I'll MC this for you, but I think I will hold off entering the project into the database as a solo until you record the story and see how long the recording turns out to be.  If it is short enough to be a single file that you can submit to the sci fi collection, you can do that, and I will just ditch this thread.  If it needs to be 2 or more files, then I'll set it up as a solo and catalog it accordingly.  Sound good?
