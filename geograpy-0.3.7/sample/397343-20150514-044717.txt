section 129http://upload.librivox.org/share/uploads/ks/lifeofjesuscriticallyexamined_129_strauss.mp323:27, 21.4Mb  My submitted recordings for this book now total 48 hours and 11 minutes.  Over TWO DAYS worth of listening   (if anyone can stand listening to my voice for that long...) With still another 150 pages to go, I have to wonder if I am going to break some kind of Librivox record for a solo recording.  Any idea?
