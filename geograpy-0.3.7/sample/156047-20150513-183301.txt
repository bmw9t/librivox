Kim,Two more posted and ready for PL.  I'm going down now to do a bit more reading.  Just three more sections, so maybe I can get them read tonight.It was a hard day at work.  Lot of little things are annoying me.  Left hand doesn't know what the right is doing.  I need an attitude adjustment.  Probably getting hit with this because I've been praying to be filled with the HS.  http://www.keepbelieving.com/sermon/how-can-i-be-filled-with-the-holy-spirit/  Anything good in the spiritual life is likely to face resistance from some quarter.  Good night's rest usually puts a different face on it when tomorrow comes.Looking forward to touching base.MaryAnn
