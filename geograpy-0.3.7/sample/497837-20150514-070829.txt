I can correct it and upload the files again, or leave it and be consistent with the file naming scheme. Let me know what you want me to do.EDIT by Barry: I have fixed this now.Also, is it necessary for me to keep copies of the audio files of projects that have been catalogued? Is min being notified as sections are uploaded for this project?ThanksRichard
