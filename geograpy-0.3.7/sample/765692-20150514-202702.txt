Thank you jo.

Intros are being read, footnotes at your discretion (personally I tend to read them if they're useful and leave them out if they say something like "see p10").

I guess the main thing about timing is to get it done by the deadline. The week turnaround thing is an attempt to prevent last-minute orphanings. So, in other words, yes that's fine, but I'll probably be pm-ing you to make sure things are on track.

Many thanks,
Carl.
