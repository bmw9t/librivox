Thanks very much for volunteering. I have made the edits to Chapter 1 and updated the Magic Window.Glad you like the way I sound. For my part, I never realized how much I slurred my words until I tried this. I must sound like Finster from The Usual Suspects in my everyday life. I'll use the short form for the rest of the chapters. Chapter 2 should be along in a couple of days.
