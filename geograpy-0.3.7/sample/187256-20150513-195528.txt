Welcome, Betty.  It will be nice to work with you again.  And I apologize, Tricia, for the anachronism.  I have now corrected my link.I have completed the reading, so I expect the project to be complete before the end of April.  I will proof it a last time before it reaches Betty, adding the intros and endings.  I'll get the prelude up today.Tom
