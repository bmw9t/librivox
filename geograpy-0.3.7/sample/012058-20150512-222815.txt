Hi my name is Lori, I live in Alaska and I have wanted to read audio books since I first heard about books on cassettes.  I am a Girl Scout Service Unit manager in my free time and I work as a Juvenile Justice Officer for the State of Alaska.  I learned about librivox from the itunes store and I have downloaded several books from that website.  I have been told that I have a good voice and I am a trainer for "Restorative Justice" and "Gender Specific Programs" so I am used to public speaking.   I think this is a great idea and I personally enjoy classic novels, Elizabeth Gaskell and Jane Austin are two of my favorite authors.  I really enjoy Mark Twain and Alexander Solzhenitsyn.  I bought a "Snowball" microphone to start recording chapters with so I'm figuring out how to use it today.
