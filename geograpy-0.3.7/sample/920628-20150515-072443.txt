I took a while to graduate college - finally doing so in 2004 (at 34yrs of age) and I busted my @$$ getting done and completing two degree programs.

I've applied for a number of jobs and not been called or interviewed for any, then a couple of months ago I apply for a job, maybe the perfect job for me - computer forensics specialist.

I just had a call for an interview with the State agency... they told me they have a zero tolerance policy for drug use - hey no big deal - then she says, past/present/future zero tolerance.

So it looks like the one time (Oct 31, 1985) that I puffed the magic dragon has actually come back to haunt me... if I'm selected I have to succumb to a polygraph, so I don't think I can avoid being busted.

D@mn.

I needed to vent  :x  some place other than to my co-workers...
