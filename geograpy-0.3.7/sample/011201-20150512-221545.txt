Welcome to LibriVox HoH   Your test file specs are correct, but the volume is too loud, the waveforms are peaking causing a bit of distortion, the waveforms should look lke this..There is a bit of DC offset which is of the stubborn variety that Audacity can't remove with the Normalize effect, but can be cured with the high pass filter effect in Audacity with a 12 db Rolloff and cutoff frequency of 80Hz. There is also some mic noise, bumping of sorts - are you using a headset?
