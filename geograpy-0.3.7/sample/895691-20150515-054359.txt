I don't PL much (and tend to do it in Winamp because I'm lazy) but I have listened to commercially produced files through Soundbooth, which I use instead of Audacity.  I find it really interesting to see the volume, pacing, and so on in the same view as I normally look at my own voice.  I would hugely recommend this to any reader, whether you're PLing or listening for pleasure.  I don't do it often, but I always get a slightly better perspective on my own work.
