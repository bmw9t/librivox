Hi Elijah!There are lots of open parts in this project. It would be great if you could take one (or more!)A dramatic reading is different from a regular reading of a book because instead of claiming a chapter and reading the whole chapter, you claim a character and record only the lines assigned to that character.To see what lines to read, read from the scripts. Here's one. If you wanted to read, say, the Little Boy, you would read only the lines in light blue, each separated by a few seconds of silence. Does that make sense?Thank you!
