Ceschino, unfortunately you've fallen victim to the fact that we get lots of people who claim roles with their very first post and then never post again--so when you didn't respond to my post and my question to you, and hadn't posted again on the forum, I did take the role 'off hold' as it were. However, there are lots of good parts still left, so once your test recording has been approved, I hope you'll come back and choose one (or two!)
