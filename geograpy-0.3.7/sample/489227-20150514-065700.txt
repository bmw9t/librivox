This discussion had focused mainly on the benefit and difficulty of collecting new languages.

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is also important for another reason: it is a major historical document and is the foundation statement on human rights.  It would be a very important document even if it were only available in one language.

I don't think we should try to get only one or a few readers per language. We should try to get as many readers as possible.  Recording the Declaration in your own voice is a personal declaration by the reader.  I want as many people to make that declaration as we can possibly get.  I am personally willing to read the declaration not just once, but many times.

Presented properly, this is a project that could inspire people who have been too shy to record.  This is their opportunity to make an important personal statement.  The quality of their voice doesn't matter.  It is a personal statement.  If we are lucky, we can inspire them to get their friends to listen to their recording and inspire their friends to record, too.

Collecting more recordings in English and other major languages will also help the project achieve a critical mass.  The first volume(s) will be completed more quickly, and the process will become routine.
