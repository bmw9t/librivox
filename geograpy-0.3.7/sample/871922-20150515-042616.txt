There was a recurring question of "HOW DO YOU MAKE MONEY ON THIS?"  in many of the sessions.  Ironically, the people in the room who have succeeded in making boatloads of money from podcasting were talking about how your establish trust in your audience and build community.  Julien Smith of the "In Over Your Head HipHop Podcast" and a manager of the podsafe music network has had great financial success from podcasting.  He emphatically said something like, "Stop talking about how to monetize your stupid podcast and start building trust with your audience.  If you build a community other things will follow."  
Hugh and I also said many times that there are other reasons for doing this than monetary gain.
