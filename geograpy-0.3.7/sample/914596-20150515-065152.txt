GCSE are a combo of CSE (Certificate of secondary education) and GCE (General Certificate of Education)
GCE was for the more academic students and CSE for those whose talents lay elsewhere.
Of course this was considered terribly exclusionary so the exams/coursework were combined and are a strange sort of hybrid beastie that can only work if you try to bend it back into the shape it was before.
You take the final exams at age 16 and then move on to higher education or out into the world of work - in my case I moved on to social security payments and an endless treadmill of job interviews which went on for about 2 years before I found a job (it were tough back then).
