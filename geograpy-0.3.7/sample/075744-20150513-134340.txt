I would greatly appreciate it.   You don't need to post the link i this thread, but please do post a reply saying you have uploaded it again.  If you don't still have a copy on your computer, I need to know that too.   Many thanks and sorry for the inconvenience.Is the file still on the Librivox Uploader?Librivox Uploader wrote:If you upload a file twice (with the same filename), the first upload will be renamed so it is not overwritten.Yes, the file is still on the uploaded but it is not easy to fix it and the best solution is to upload the original file again.  This puts the proper file with the proper name right back where it should be and keeps me from screwing up the files which I have a tendency to do whenever I mess with them <sigh>.   Trust me, I've been down this path (fiddling with FileZilla) and it is amazing how I can make mistakes.  I checked the first post by the way and it is not at all clear how to name the files.  Sorry for that. The templet is not standard at all and I will fix it. EDIT: no this won't hurt the project.  We are all cool here.
