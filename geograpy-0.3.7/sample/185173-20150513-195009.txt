The update: http://dev.librivox.org/uploads/dlolso21/aviationinstructorshandbook_3_faa_128kb.mp31:02:18Rapunzelina I guess i need a better "pre-flight checklist."  I had the first two additions (intro and 1st text omission) on my computer and just hadn't added them.  And thanks for the reminder about starting from the end. I always do that, but since i couldn't believe i forgot to add the intro, i almost started from the front. I'm suspecting the last two mistakes were just sloppy editing on my part (cutting too much), but considering all the repeats and cuts i make, I will forgive myself and thank you again for doing such a great job.DavidNote since the new name is slightly different than the old "  _faa_128kb.mp3" instead of " _faa._128kb.mps" (Dot before _128)  the earlier version will need to be deleted separately.Thanks, Norm
