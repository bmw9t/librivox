Thanks for the PL Shelagh. I think something is up with my version of Audacity...never had any problems of this kind til this project, so I think something in my set-up has gone wonky.

I exported the file as a 128kb and it still says that it is when I check it...so I cannot fathom why it is showing up as 160kb (what an odd rate!?).

Also, although there is silence at the end, you're not the only one to have it malfunction on you. Hmmmm. Every time I export to an MP3, Audacity crashes at the very end of the process. However, when I test the MP3 file, it seems fine, so I haven't worried.

Now, however, I think it's doing something weird. Let me install a slightly earlier version of Audacity (if I can still find it) and then re-export 19 and 20 and see if that fixes it. I'll do this tonight (PST) and get them up there for ya.
