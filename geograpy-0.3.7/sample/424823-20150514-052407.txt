I have been running in the 96 db range and then using mp3 gain to see how much I needed to lower it by using amplify and putting in a negative gain in audacity.  I think I forgot to do that this time.  MikeHi Mike,The amplification is fine. The file name should have had cory instead of corey. There is no need to change it. Jo can do it when she catalogs the project.Great reading! PL OK. What a nice way to end the book!Also I was wondering if you have any interest in the dramatic reading projects, narrating or acting? I have one I am planning. Thanks!-Amy
