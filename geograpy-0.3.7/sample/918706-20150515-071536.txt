We must record all the texts at marxists.org,
especially,

Das Kapital

in every language,
with translation into each language's currency,

replace 19th century examples of capitalism (yarn spinning, early bank credit), with 21st century circuits of commodity sale and capital production (audio book recording, Wal-Mart, pornography / sexual slave trade, accurate #s of crack, heroin, marijuana)

Include with the site and phpBB board specifically designed for this project, a separate area where different reports, resolutions, observations, and carefully built truth-finding can be presented publically and debated.

Sort out the Truth Finding area, described above, according to strict guidelines --- (accurate/inaccurate, helpful/harmful, consistent/inconsistent)...

With an overt, public purpose, of curing the human-harming-human problem that is so hideously manifested in finance capital imperialism.

Feed in the numbers from the world's stock markets, into the interstices of the text of Das Kapital, offering commentary beside contradictions.

To understand the tone of the entire project, listen to 'Jettison Sequence', a 6 hour reading of the last chapter to "Letter to a Responsible Party", the second volume of Paradigm from California,  www.imaginenine.com

The recordings are at:   www.BerkeleyMayor.org
