David,

The read is great. There is alot of background activity in the recording though. Near the beginning when you first start the poem, one can hear a couple of cars drive by, and throughout the remainder there are birds chirping. It might just be the sensitivity of my equipment that allows mw to pick that up so lets see what others have to say.

Great to hear your voice.
