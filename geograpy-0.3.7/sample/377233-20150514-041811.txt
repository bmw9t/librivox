When you read a loud portion, there can be some clipping. When you record your next section you might lower the volume on your mic setting a little.So I've read the note here, and the Magic Window still shows that I need to do that. Does it actually mean that, before it's OK'ed, I have to re-submit the reading at a lower volume? My understanding was that I should watch the volume more closely in the future (which I am).cheers
