Just a quick question about the intro  --  It specifies [Chapter #], but there are two sections and the chapter numbers start with Chapter One for both sections.  I think it might be confusing, therefore, to have only a chapter number in the intro.  Would you like to have the  intro more like [Section name] [Chapter #]?By the way, when I am up-to-date on my current assignments, I may claim "Insect Musicians,"  if no one has taken it.  It is long and challenging with all of the Japanese in it.  It would be great to have someone who speaks Japanese fluently to do that one.  We'll see.
