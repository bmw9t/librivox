Betsie,

If you mean something specific to LibriVox, I believe the answer is "No".

Here's a brief start (forum and wiki accounts are independent):
 Go to the Wiki: http://www.librivox.org/wiki/ Create an account for yourself: click on "Login" Click the "HelpContents" tab Notice the two links: HelpOnPageCreation - how to create a new page HelpOnEditing - how to edit a pageThey're on their way.
