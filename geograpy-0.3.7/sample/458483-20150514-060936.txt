(Granted, this is a pronunciation issue, so it's not a required fix. But it does change the meaning...)Hey thanks for these PL edits!  That makes sense about 1:11.  What should I do about "general distortion"?  Deamplify a bit?  I used leveler and think already de-amplified.  Will make sure recording mic is at at good level for future recordings.
