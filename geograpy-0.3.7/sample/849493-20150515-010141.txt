Praise for bgdavid (David Clarke) via the 'Thank a reader' feature:  Quote:Mr. Clarke,Thank you so very much for your reading of The Count of Monte Cristo.I've been listening to it on my drive to and from work over the last few months and have absolutely loved the way you told the story.I can't imagine the time and energy it must have taken to finish this project, but I have enjoyed every moment of it.I have read the book before but listening to the way you tell the story, with the voices and emotion you used, made the experience so much more enjoyable.Thank you for your time, care, and dedication,Luke All of David's recordings
