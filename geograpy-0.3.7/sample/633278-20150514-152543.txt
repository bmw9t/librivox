Greeting a new member here on LibriVox, Henrik Hageland, Denmark. 

Welcome, Henrik! Yes, I should be delighted to include a Danish short story. Bang died in 1912, so all of his work must be in the Public Domain. 

You may wish to read through the Newbie Guide to Recording and do a short test recording to make sure that all your settings are OK.

I look forward to hearing from you.
