Well, we have a full batch of fine readers and the project pushes forward just that fraction more.

Nikolle has bagged the last section and we should now progress forward to catch up with chapter 2 which is awaiting us already in 'readers found'.

Anyone reading this who might fear they've missed their chance of indulging in a reading of this magnificent history then, fear not.
There are 2 more chapters in the readers wanted forum and many more to come. I've seen this history referred to as the largest standard (whatever that means) work in the English language.
