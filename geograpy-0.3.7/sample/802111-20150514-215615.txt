Perhaps I can contribute something along the lines of the loneliness of the long-distance soloist...RuthThat is so true. Having done the unabridged Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea (only my second solo), which took 3 months of extreme dedication, I learned the importance of the MC and a DPL'er who stays right with you on the project.  Knowing that someone is going to listen, and SOON, can be the only thing standing between the reader and total isolation, and maybe even demotivation. I also fantasized that Verne was standing over my shoulder, connecting with me as I connected with him, urging me on.  And then there was the world of future listeners to contemplate.  I tried to read for them as if they were waiting in the wings.  Corny techniques, perhaps, but it did keep me going through some long and tedious moments.If I had known how vexing all those scientific terms would be to pronounce like I knew them, and research, research, and edit, edit 'til I got them all right, I would NEVER have begun the project!  And which characters needed which voices!  So I can certainly speak to reading your material ahead of time!
