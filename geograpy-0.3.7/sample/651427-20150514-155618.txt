Several! Though not all of the songs have surviving tunes that are traceable back to Shakespeare's period (the ones I know for "Under the Greenwood Tree" and "Blow, Blow, Thou Winter's Wind" are actually 18th-century). At any rate there's a lot of information in Ross Duffin's Shakespeare's Songbook, including information on the provenance of the tunes (he also engages in a lot of conjectural matching of songs to tunes). I'll probably fit those two to period tunes; as I said, I'm kind of an early music geek.
