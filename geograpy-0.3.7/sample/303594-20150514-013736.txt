Etel - the recording is great, but I notice there's a copyright notice on the page: "Copyright 1945, 1951, 8 1955, 1979, 1983 by the President and Fellows of Harvard College.  Reprinted with the permission of The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press." We'll need to find a different source for it (one that isn't under copyright).EDIT: I found it here: http://www.theotherpages.org/poems/dickin01.html#15 so I'll use that as the source.
