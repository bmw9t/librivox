That's actually one of my all-time favorites; I just hadn't gotten to it yet in my unsystematic search.  So glad you reminded me!   The other one looks like a pretty hymn, but I'm having a hard time understanding the verse below.  (I like to make sure I know the meaning of what I'm singing, at least on some level.   )  I think I understand the protection or "breastplate" provided by what is named in the rest of the verses, but I can't figure this one out.  Maybe I'm missing the obvious, but can you explain how you understand it?Quote:I bind unto myself todayThe virtues of the star lit heaven,The glorious sun’s life giving ray,The whiteness of the moon at even,The flashing of the lightning free,The whirling wind’s tempestuous shocks,The stable earth, the deep salt seaAround the old eternal rocks.Thanks!bookAngel7
