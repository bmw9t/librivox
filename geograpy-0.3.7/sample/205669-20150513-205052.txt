Welcome to LibriVox! Thanks, I've signed you up for sections 17-19. Please read the first post of this thread carefully.

Please let me know under which name or pseudonym you'd like to appear in the LibriVox catalogue. We can also link to a personal web site/blog.

Great that you already have recording experience. Usually I ask that new readers send in a 1-minute test recording: This is not an audition, it's just to make sure the sound quality and the recording settings are all right - often things can be improved at the outset that are difficult to fix later. You don't need to do that, but please go to this wiki page to find out about the settings we use so you can be sure they're all correct before you start a long section.
