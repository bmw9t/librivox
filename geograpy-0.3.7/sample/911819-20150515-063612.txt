Well, one poster dropped Afghanistan into the subject, and I mentioned the Islamist terrorist bombings in London, but I can't see anything that is yet off-topic enough to warrant even a gentle nudge, let alone an "official warning".
I'm guessing that there's probably a post that has been deleted, hence we can't see it, hence that was what is was directed at.
