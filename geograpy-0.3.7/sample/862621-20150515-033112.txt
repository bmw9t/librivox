Thank you so much for posting your point of view, Ian (how pervasive the imagery of sight is - 'imagery': there's another one...). I'm glad that LibriVox and others are helping you enjoy fiction again. 
Making texts accessible for people with a visual impairment is only one of the many and varied motivating factors for LibriVoxers, but it's really valuable to hear about your experiences and be reminded of the importance of audio books to people in your situation.
Hope you'll find lots more recordings to enjoy here!
