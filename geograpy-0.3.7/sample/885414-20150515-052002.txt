I have a refurbed Sansa (e260, mebbe ... it's downstairs and I'm up.)  With an 8GB memory card, it's the best thing I've ever had.

That said, for some years I used unbranded plain MP3 players, running on an AAA battery, with 1-2GB memory, and they mostly worked fine, starting up where they left off, and playing in order.  The important thing with those was to be able to organise books within folders, as I had one player which didn't support folders, and so played all the Chapter 1s it could find, then all the Chapter 2s (I passed that one onto a friend asap!)  With folders, it's all good, flexible, and even 1GB would fit most 64kbps-rate books with a bit of relaxing music on the side.
