All the ones without names beside them are “up for grabs.” Click "Post reply" at the top left of the screen and tell us which section you’d like to read (include the section number from the left-most column in the reader list, please). Read points 6. to 8. below for what to do before, during and after your recording. New to recording? Please read our Newbie Guide to Recording! Is there a deadline? Target completion date of this project: 31 March 2009 – but try to send your recordings as soon as you can. If you cannot do your section, for whatever reason, just let me know and it’ll go back to the pool. There’s no shame in this; we’re all volunteers and things happen. If I don't hear from a reader for 2 months after a section has been claimed, the section will go back to the pool (claim dates are noted in the Magic Window below). So please post an update before the two months are up, even if just to say that you need more time.Where do I find the text? Source text (please only read from this text!): http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/5946 I have indicated the word count of each section in the Notes field;  forum discussions have shown that people read on average 130-190 words per minute. Please claim sections (the numbers in the first column below)! MAGIC WINDOW: (Admin link)BEFORE recording: Please check the Recording Notes:
