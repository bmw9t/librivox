The PL notes for the final section 18 are:The silence at the beginning of the recording is a bit too long with a length of almost 2 seconds. @ 00:47 [p. 487] the word "into" I "into opposites" is cut off in the middle. (possible to copy&paste from 1:15).@ 41:30 you read "moved more swiftly" but in the text [ p. 518] it is "most swiftly". (possible to copy&paste from 41:32).Already (more later  ) a very big congratulations to you, Geoff!
