One of mine lived to the ripe old age of 15 -- outside, which is long for a yard-cat.Dogs bark, pee on everything, are incapable of cleaning themselves, and don't have the brains to cover their doo.  The only thing they're really good for is hunting & protection.

I second Neeru's question. And that's not a good enough answer! How many "service" cats have you heard of, hmm? I didn't think so. 

My dog Chi-Chi, a beautiful, dignified Chihuahua (I mean it!) lived to 17!! And Chi-Chi was clean (she kept herself very clean!), she didn't bark that much (especially as she got older), at 5 pounds she was VERY easy to maintain, she was playful & loving (was ALWAYS right by my left side here on the bed with me) . . . & believe you me, she was useful! She helped keep me company when I was so ill I couldn't do anything--- she loved me so much that she was my shadow; she was a wonderful companion! We had to finally let her go on June 26, 2006 because of heart failure, and I still miss her! 

Now Paco (almost 14) has picked up right where she left off & is always with me.  We also have an outside cat right now that we named Shadow; she's feral; we're going to have to catch her soon (she's still small, only about 3 months old) so we can get her spayed & get her vaccinations. Pippin loves his kitty! And they play with each other at the fence. LOL 

Sorry for the ramble (humor me, K?). Oh, BT, from what I've heard, if you die alone in your house, your cat will eat you. *shudder*  

And MY dogs do NOT drool, thank you very much!
