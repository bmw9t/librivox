help email from a listener:Quote:    Hi. Love your site! I have a problem with downloading the books onto my MP3 player (sansa express by Sandisk). The chapters load in the correct order onto my computer but end up backwards on the MP3 player. This does not happen with books from the Library. Got a hint??

any ideas?
