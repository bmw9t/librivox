Hello rachelellen,

you've decided to tackle a solo project - thanks and congratulations. This is not such a great difference to reading a single chapter (except that it takes more time   ). You only have to choose your id3-tags yourself. I'll be your Metacoordinator. You can deliver your files by using my uploader at www.librivox.prolegomena.org , the password for uploading files is "public". I will also store your files there until the project is finished. If you have your own webspace you can - of course - use it, otherwise you can always use yousendit and post the links in this thread. 
The book you read can be found at Gutenberg: http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/550
And at last I have to disappoint you: I have no idea how to pronounce Raveloe  
If you have any questions, just ask!!!

Greetings and have fun with our recording,

Rainer
