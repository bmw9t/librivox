Thanks, I learned so many AMAZING things from this fellow--I had no idea that birds had died from the inability to pronounce a word--so glad this didn't happen to me back in the Elements of... or or help me! some of those that had you going back and forth between languages until you couldn't even pronounce your own.Seriously though, I love these old texts, there really is so much to learn on so many levels.Michelle
