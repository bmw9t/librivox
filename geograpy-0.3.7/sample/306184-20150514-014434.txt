I think I may know what happened, but no matter. I've tacked on the missing pages to the section in question and reuploaded. If you had pl'ed until the silence, Dave, you can pick up again at 31:18. I took the opportunity to slow down the tempo of the recording (along with a couple of other files), so the missing part now starts at 31:18.    Cathy
