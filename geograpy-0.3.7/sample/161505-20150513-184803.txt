Better get the ball rolling!  I think the first line, "Enter!", is not intended for Rateau, but for one of Mme Theot's servants. I've included it, but I don't think it's mine.  The text mentions Rateau's coughing fits a few times. I've put those in in case you want to run them under the narration, probably after muting them somewhat.Rateau, Chapter 3: http://upload.librivox.org/share/uploads/al/triumphofthescarletpimpernel_rateau_03_orczy.mp3Duration: 3:22ish.
