I do have a back-up of the page, though it's somewhat (ok...horribly) out of date. Real Life prevents me from starting up the wiki page again and getting everything synced back up. But if anyone is interested in doing so, please PM me and I'll be happy to give them what I have.

I miss that page! I I tried to find it on the waybackmachine as well as in Google's cache but it does not seem to be available. Perhaps you could be bothered to at least post the text from your backup to this thread? It wouldn't matter if things like the formatting, alignment and links would be wrong because it would still be much better than nothing at all which is currently the case!
