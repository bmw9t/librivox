I'm new-ish here, and you're obviously an old hand at doing these plays, so I leave which parts of the stage directions you want to read up to your discretion. I'm not sure if the general practice is to read them all or read only the parts that actually set the scene.

I hope you enjoy Duchess of Malfi - and glad you've enjoyed House of Mirth.  

I will probably read all the stage directions and then it'll be up to you in the editing process which you cut and which you keep.  We debated the issue of descriptive stage directions when we were doing Strindberg's "Countess Julie" and decided that LibriVox policy for reading the whole text meant that we should keep them all in.  But it can kind of disrupt the flow of a play a bit, so it's really finally up to you...
