Hi Jud,

I did notice one thing Jodi did not (but more my job to check on this anyway), your ID3 tags for the file need to be changed.  

Yours are currently this:
Artist: P/T. Barnum
Title: Chapter 11
Album: Humbugs of the World

The tags should be set up like this:
Artist: P. T. Barnum
Title: 11 - Chapter 11
Album: The Humbugs of the World

Just re-upload the same as before when you have made the changes and the other file will get overwritten (well, actually it gets backed up with a slightly different name).
