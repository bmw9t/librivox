Ah, that website has linked the wrong m4b.  However, that is not a site that we have any control over; they are completely separate from Librivox though they do use some of our recordings.  (Our recordings are in the public domain, so you will find them all over the Internet on other people's sites.)In the meantime, you can find the recording on its original page in the Librivox catalog here:http://librivox.org/the-apology-of-socrates-by-plato/Or if you prefer the Greek:http://librivox.org/apology-of-socrates-by-plato/I see that the title of the m4b listed on our catalog page is wrong (the m4b itself is not directly linked, which is normal).  I am not seeing m4b versions of either The Apology of Socrates or Selected Dialogues of Plato in the list in the Wiki.  They're probably there somewhere, so I will alert the people who make m4b's so they can look into it.
