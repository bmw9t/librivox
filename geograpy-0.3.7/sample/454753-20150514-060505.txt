  Now LOOK, missy. If you are going to sing in these chapters you cannot expect me to wait until the upload finishes without happydancing all around the room!!! (And that is not within my pay grade!)(I'm also a church musician who has plumbed the depths of the cyberhymnal many a time, who plays a highly-portable autoharp.)Nope-- too late..... can't stand it. Happydancing breaktime, everyone!  ~Susan(Librivox crashes as a million fans upload that chapter simultaneously.....)
