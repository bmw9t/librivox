Section 07 Editing NotesAn excellent job, David! You have a great reading voice, and I love hearing these stories in the native British accent. I can't wait to find out how this ends!There are 6 corrections, three of which are missing sentences. Whether these came from overzealous editing of multiple takes, or simply skipping over them, I can't say. Here's a handy editing tip:Go to the end of the list of fixes and record the last one first, and work your way up the list, editing from right to left in the audio waveform. Doing your corrections this way will keep the time stamps of the "preceding" corrections at the same place in the file.01:12 Missing sentence immediately following "... of an extraordinarily pretty girl;" though in some of the photographs it was wonderful that her prettiness was so evident, for so  frightened and startled was her expression, that it was difficult not to believe that she had been photographed in the presence of some imminent and overwhelming danger.02:42 Delete or silence a strange audio artifact that can be heard during a pause between 'I've' and 'been' in:"I've been North,"06:23 Missing sentence following " ... inexplicable manifestations" :You begin to understand now, I think, just how extraordinary a business it was that I was asked to look into.07:52 Incorrect word "night" instead of "night-time" in:"Three nights later, Beaumont was awakened by a strange neighing in the night-time,09:07 Missing word "front" in:the sound of a horse, outside the front door.20:48 Missing sentence following " ... so I knew he had heard them also." :I suggested that it might be well to leave the bedroom door open a little, until the dawn came in, as there was certainly something abroad. This was done, and he went back into the room, to be near his wife and daughter.
