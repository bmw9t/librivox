Hi Gordon -

Sure; which ones would you like?  Just make sure they are in separate acts, so there's no confusion for the listener.  Let me know which ones you're interested in.

Also, if it's not too much of a pain, it would be preferable to have them in separate files.  I know it seems kind of ridiculous if they're really small roles, but from an editing standpoint it makes things SO much easier.  Thanks.
