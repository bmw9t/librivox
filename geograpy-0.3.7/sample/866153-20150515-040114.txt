From what I know, this can be done, with a .lrc file. 

BUT, it's enormous work, since you have to basically write it line by line, and input the time at which the text would appear. I've thought about doing this a few weeks ago, but then figured that I wasn't going to spend 2-3 times the duration of the recording just to make a .lrc file. 

The end result would be a file that goes like this: 

[00:15] Roses are red, violets are blue
[00:18] Sugar is sweet, and so are you
[00:20] The next line of the text goes here
[00:23] And then some more until the end.
