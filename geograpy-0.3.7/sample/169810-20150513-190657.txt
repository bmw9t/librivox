If you would prefer to carry on with it as a normal group project I understand. Thank you for considering my request.Hi as no one has yet signed up to any sections I am happy to assign you the few that are left. I am happy to keep it for you to do as long as you check in to let me know when you intend to start. I am happy for the sections to come in slowly as long as they are reasonably regular possibly as a start 1 a month(or whatever you feel would be appropriate for you to do). Let me know if that would be acceptable and an anticipated start date. Thanks
