Vina, if it's any help Maxfarce is pronouncing it "ASH-yul" and that's how I was imagining it and intend to read it too.

I'm pronouncing Inverashiel (the house) as IN-ver-ASH-yul (Maxfarce pronounces it InVERashul but I can't seem to get my tongue round that) and McConachan as Mc-CON-a-han.

Edited to add: Also could I please sign up for Chapter 18? (Having carefully checked it for Scottish accents, which I can't do!)
