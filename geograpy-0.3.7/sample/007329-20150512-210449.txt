Hello and welcome, ZQ!I have a "stupid phone," so texting and emailing while mobile isn't in the cards for me yet. But it is impressive to me how universal a tool the phone has become - everything from a video camera to a baby toy. I'm still very new here myself, but I hope you find the folks here just as friendly and helpful as I have. I probably spent the first 3 days doing nothing but reading the wiki. I found that extremely helpful for me. Here's the link to it, if you haven't found it yet.Some people also find the instructional videos helpful. There's something reassuring watching and listening to someone explain a task. Here is the link to the member-made instructional videos.And I think those are duplicates of links in the "welcome, new volunteer!" email.  Don't forget to submit a 1-minute test in the "Listeners Wanted" section.If you get stuck or have a question, just post your question in the "Need help? Got advice?" forum. The response times are fairly quick there!See you on the boards ~ Chessie Joy
