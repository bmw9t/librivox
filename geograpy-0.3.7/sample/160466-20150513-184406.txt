Which recording program are you using?  If it is Audacity, do you have LAME downloaded?  You need that plug-in in order for Audacity to export in .mp3.Your file is in stereo, we need it to do mono.There was some clipping, which means that the peaks of your recording go out of the recording window because your mic volume is too high.  But I can't check the volume because the file is .wav.What kind of mic are you using?  Are you using a Windows based system, or an Apple product? Please try again, but post it in the Listeners Wanted Forum.  Someone there can give you better advice than I can if you are using a different recording program and/or system.
