Hi All,

This is Lee Storm, "n2fgc" in Madison, NJ.  I found Librivox through searching for something on Google and have ben entranced by the treasure-trove of books.  For a blind reader, this place is tremendous!  I really think word should be spread to the communities of the print impaired of the existence of this font of goodies.

I apologize for the plainness of this text, but as a blind user, I'm used to plain text mail and all this styling stuff is totally beyond me and serves no purpose to me, per se.  So I ask patience with this "Plain Lady." :-)  True, I used to do TRoff when I worked at Bell Labs, but that was some time ago.

I'm 47, happily married, and both my husband and myself enjoy a good audio book together...good sharing time!  Both of us are Amateur Radio operators and involved with our local Emergency Management.  Our interests are many and varied.

Thanks for all the hard work and know that it's appreciated.  I know all the coordinating, production and assorted other tasks can be most labor-intensive, but we love you for doing them

Sincerely,

Lee :-)
