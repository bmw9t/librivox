Hulstrand,Not sure when you posted your final section . . .    . . . it is appreciated, even on a solo, if you post in the thread when you upload files so that the MC can keep track of how the project is progressing.  That also keeps your project near the top of the "going solo" forum, and lets potential PLers (who may be looking for projects based on the ~ in the thread title) that you are making progress on the project.There are instructions here on how to advertise for a DPL:  viewtopic.php?p=318668#p318668MaryAnn
