First of all I enjoyed your reading and your British accent is a nice change to all these North Americans (guess where I was born).

Your recording level is a little low and I amplified it by 4.4db using Audacity without clipping or introducing any significant noise.

I checked your reading accuracy against the Gutenberg text and you have made one or two little errors such as:
"see me tomorrow during waking hours." 
instead of:
"see me tomorrow during working hours. "
but none which affected the implied meaning of the text.
During "real" proof listening I would not even bother to comment.

I did not  notice any stumbles which affected the reading.

Finally don't forget the full introduction and ending as per LibriVox requirements.

I look forward to the full recording.
