Hello,https://librivox.org/uploads/tests/test_lancashirebilby.mp3I've just recorded my one-minute test using a smartphone connected by USB and a great little voice recorder app called SmartVoice. It's CD quality audio and the stocking-over-the-coat-hanger worked brilliantly as a pop filter.Please feel free to leave feedback and contact me when you need a professional radio journalist with a slight northern English accent for your solo or collaborative works!Best wishes,LancashireBilby
