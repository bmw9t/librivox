"You know, there are many people in the country today, who, through no fault of their own, are sane.  Some of them were born sane; some of them became sane later in their life.  It is up to people, like you and me, who are out of our tiny little minds, to try and help these people overcome their sanity."  Rev. Arthur Belling
