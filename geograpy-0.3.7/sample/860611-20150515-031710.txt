I often preview files in the audioplayer at the Internet Archive page (linked to on each catalogue page), just to check that I am happy that all the files meet my own personal standards (which are not usually too high).

Think this is a worthwhile thing to discuss. LibriVox tends to be quite strongly opposed to making any reader feel that their contribution is not appreciated. However, ideas for improving the experience of listeners will not be ignored.
