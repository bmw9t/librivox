Hi Astro21,

I bought the same device 2 days ago. I have to put the input level on the pre amp around half. My output level is at about 1/4. The phantome power options is pressed and the +20db option is pressed. I plug it into the line in on the boss (avoiding the internal mic. or instument pre amps on the boss). Record level fully open on the boss. No problems. When I exceed these levels on the pre amp I get a buzz to. But it works perfect on the levels I described. I have a MCA SP1 mic. 

good luck
