Igot Bowers to go, by agreeing to exchange ranks with him for the timebeing, and go along and stand the watch with him as his subordinate.  Westayed out there a couple of dreary hours in the pitchy darkness and therain, with nothing to modify the dreariness but Bowers's monotonousgrowlings at the war and the weather; then we began to nod, and presentlyfound it next to impossible to stay in the saddle; so we gave up thetedious job, and went back to the camp without waiting for the reliefguard.  We rode into camp without interruption or objection from anybody,and the enemy could have done the same, for there were no sentries.Everybody was asleep; at midnight there was nobody to send out anotherpicket, so none was sent.  We never tried to establish a watch at nightagain, as far as I remember, but we generally kept a picket out in thedaytime.In that camp the whole command slept on the corn in the big corn-crib;and there was usually a general row before morning, for the place wasfull of rats, and they would scramble over the boys' bodies and faces,annoying and irritating everybody; and now and then they would bite someone's toe, and the person who owned the toe would start up and magnifyhis English and begin to throw corn in the dark. @35:54 “I seemed to see a hundred flashes and hear a hundred reports,” said “near”
