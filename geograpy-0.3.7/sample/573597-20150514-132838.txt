David,
Quick question concerning pronunciation of Mathilde (didn't want to just assume it's based on Ma-thil-da).
After some web searching I found these;
In Dutch three syllables are spoken: Mat - hil - de
and
In French they speak it in two syllables: Ma-teeld
Any preferences? or do you prefer another option?
ttfn,
raven.
