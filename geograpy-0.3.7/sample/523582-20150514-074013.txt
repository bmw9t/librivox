Ummm... no and no.  You can have whatever spot is available when you submit your poem.  Now, where is your poem?  I'm expecting one here and one for the new Fortnightly Poetry Collection. <drums fingers on table>

Did I hear you ask where is this new collection?

See my sig? There you go. Or there go you. Up to you.
