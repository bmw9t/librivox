Still a few more things to fix for the others:Chapter 3*At 0:30- For "it's such a strange thing she should have that fit" I hear "it's such a thing she should have that fit"- that is, "strange" was omitted.*At 1:07- For “Up where the moors spread and grey rocks are piled” I hear “Up where the moors spread and the grey rocks are piled”Chapter 10It appears that the beginning of Chapter 10 is cut off, so these lines are missing:Bessie: "It's her, I am sure!--I could have told her anywhere!"Bessie: "Well, who is it?" Bessie: "you've not quite forgotten me, I think, Miss Jane?"Then it picks up with the "Jane" in ",Miss Jane" and goes on from there. The time is different because of the missing beginning, but one of the same notes still apply here:*(now) At 0:56- For “Oh, he is not doing so well as his mama could wish” I hear “Oh, he is not doing as well as his mama could wish"[and one new one]*At 2:56- For "For “he was going on a voyage to a foreign country” I hear “for he was going on a voyage to a foreign country” Chapter 21*At 0:11- For "The doctor says she may linger a week or two yet" I hear "The doctors say she may linger a week or two yet"Thank you.
