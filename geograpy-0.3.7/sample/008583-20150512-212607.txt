Hi,  My name is Jackie, but I go by Rusty JJ.  I have just joined Librivox and am looking forward to doing something new and different especially knowing that I am doing a service for all those book lovers out there just like me.  I live in Australia and I lead a fairly busy life between a 9 year old and two jobs, but I hope I can squeeze in some time to really make a contribution.  What I like about Librivox is that I only have to take on as much as I can handle, which suits me fine.  Regards to all.Rusty
