Not sure how you feel about gender-crossing, but I'd be happy to pick up a few male roles while I'm at it (Will Scarlet especially). Let me know. Thanks!LibertyHi Liberty, Little Two-Eyes, Third Citizen and Miss Muffett are all yours! Thanks!As for a woman reading a male role, I'd prefer to stay away from that, but I have a feeling it may be necessary eventually. Do you think you can do a credible man or young boys voice?  If you want to experiment with one, and we can see what it sounds like, I'm OK with that.
