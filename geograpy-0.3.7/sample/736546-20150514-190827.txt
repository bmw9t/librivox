HOORAY!  Thanks, Ethellion!  I'm so glad we have your recording to use!  I went ahead and prooflistened since it's so short.  Your reading is perfect and I love your accent!  I hope you will read a lot more for us!

However, your recording is missing the intro and outro.  The details for these are in the first post in this thread, but I'll put them here for convenience.  Can you please record the following:

Intro:

"Chapter 15 of The Burgess Bird Book for Children.  This is a LibriVox recording.  All LibriVox recordings are in the public domain.  For more information or to volunteer, please visit LibriVox dot org.  [optional: Recorded by Ethellion.]  The Burgess Bird Book for Children, by Thornton W. Burgess.  Chapter 15:  A Swallow and One Who Isn't: The Tree Swallow and the Chimney Swift."

Outro:

"End of Chapter 15."

If you don't have time to splice that into your recording, just send it as a separate short file and I'll take care of it.  We can't catalog it without the Librivox disclaimer in the intro, and it is best (for a variety of reasons) to have it in your voice.  Thanks very much!
