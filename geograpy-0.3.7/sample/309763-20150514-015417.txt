Kat and I were just talking earlier (we're RL friends) and I think it's hard for us newbies to have a sense of scale and magnitude. An example is when someone who has been here less than a week suggests reading an incredibly huge work, like the Encyclopedia Britannica. But also when proofing and editing, it's hard to know how small a sound is too small to worry about. I think in both instances, it's the kind of knowledge we gain through experience. Until we have experience, we have to rely on those who do have the knowledge and experience to guide us.I think I turned into a sagacious elder guru for a second. ~ Chessie Joy
