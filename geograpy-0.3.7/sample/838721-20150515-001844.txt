Hi, 

A friend and I would like to collaborate (alternating chapters) on a specific work.  Sort of a friendship project between us.  Is it possible to propose a work, act as coordinator, and then alternately sign up for all the chapters so that we can do the whole thing between us?

In other words, is it permissible to volunteer, on this sort of collaborative basis (a solo reading, so to speak, but with two people)?

Regards,
