Thanks Alan, I actually started out with something else but then read your tutorial and realised I could get the firefox plugin... so easy... minutes v. hours of messing about.  Very happy with it.  Thanks for the help and the tutorial.

Really, I liked what you had done with the photo before.  I'm a windows user and it looked good to me.
