Wow, Gesine, what a cool place that must be. I hope you're doing before and after pix.

I have been doing quite well with my exercise. I'm up to 77 minutes on the treadmill and the usual sit-ups, push-ups, etc. I'm still taking it easy because of my hip, which is a lot better, but I don't want to increase the speed or the slope any more than I've got now. My goal is 90 minutes. After that, I don't know what I'll do to build up.

I have a new injury, though. Now I've hurt my wrist doing too much audio editing! Perhaps we should call this "podcasters' syndrome."
