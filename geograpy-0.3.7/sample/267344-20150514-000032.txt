Section 9 is PL OK!Section 10 has just one semi-distracting bit of background noise--maybe a chair sliding?--at about 7:28.  It's not that bad, but I think it's during a pause and might be able to be edited out.Section 2 has some sort of periodic background noise starting about 14:17 that is pretty distracting.  It isn't continuous, but it occurs at intervals through the rest of the file (see for example 21:37).  Not sure what caused it, but maybe noisecleaning those parts would remove it?Quote:Note: I read the text "16. Reading papers" from the Table of Contents, rather than from the body of the work, where there was a typo. End note.  bookAngel7
