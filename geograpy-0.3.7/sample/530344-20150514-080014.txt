Sorry, I missed it.DSayers wrote:I wonder if it is still possible to add a section 00 so that I can do the Fielding's Preface to the book.Yes, I should think so. It's certainly easy enough to do at the LV end, and I'm sure it's possible at the Archive.org end. You go ahead and record the introduction, and I'll work out how to fit it in. When there's a space in the MW, then you can upload it.DSayers wrote:By the way, Gutenberg has produced this book in two volumes: http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/9611, andhttp://www.gutenberg.org/etext/9609so both of them must be given as source texts.Actually, I did get both of these, if you'd like to check the LV page for the book.DSayers wrote:The preface I want to add in is found at:http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/13182Thanks.-dennyYou're welcome.
