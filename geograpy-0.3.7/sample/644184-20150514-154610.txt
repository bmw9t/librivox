As this is your first file , what name would you like to be credited with in the Catalogue and do you have a url you would like a link to?
There are a couple of things to remember for your next recording 
This file has a lot of clipping . It is important to keep your waves below 1 on the scale - above that the top of the waves is flattened and the sound quality is affected
You have a number of 'plosives in the file  - caused by the sharp puff of air hitting the microphone , particularly on sounds like P B Th. The way to avoid this is microphone positioning - if a head set move it up or down a little so the air goes past it, with a stand mic a little to one side - just find the spot for you , where volume is good and air blasts absent

THe story was well read and interesting - there is one missed edit at 11:51 "said Victor  Cried Victor"
