I must confess that after listening the recording by Jack Daniel I checked some of my own - in comparison mine did sound a little dusty.  It is not perfect world, alas.By the way the Neuman TLM-102 is an exceptionally good microphone in its price range:  there are microphones which cost three times as much that don't sound nearly as good.Cheers
