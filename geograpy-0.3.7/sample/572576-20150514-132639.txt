Pleonic, Leon has had an attack of Real-Life-itis, and as far as I know hasn't been able to follow the fora recently, so if you or Lomond need anything MC-wise, shoot one of the MCs a PM. I'll try to keep an eye on this thread, but I can't guarantee that I'll see all of the posts. If you send me a PM, I should be able to respond within 12 hours at the outside, but probably more like 1-2 hours. But if you need anything quickly, you can shoot any MC who's online a PM asking for assistance.
