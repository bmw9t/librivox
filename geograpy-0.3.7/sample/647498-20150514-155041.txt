Chapter 15 (17 minutes 10 seconds)

Like several novels in the 19th century, this one was sometimes published in three volumes. Since the Gutenberg text has "End Book I," I read that.

I note, however, that the Gutenberg text also follows the pattern of renumbering the chapters for Volume II...so rather than Chapter 16, it reads the next chapter as "Chapter 1" 

Is it acceptable for me to continue to label the chapters sequentially, or must I read the Chapter numbers as they are in the Gutenberg text? (I've seen at least one or two older editions that number the chapters sequentially when publishing the entire novel in one volume.)
