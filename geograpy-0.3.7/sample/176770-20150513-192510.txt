Oh, I'm sorry, IE is Internet Explorer and it did something odd to the coding in the top post when I went to edit.  It's still readable, though, and I'll fix it soon.  The top post had the University of Adelaide text linked until yesterday; I'm glad you were reading from Gutenberg.If you have files ready, you can upload them to the new uploader even if you can't access the Magic Window.  The link and the password to it are in the top post.  You can go ahead and do that (just post the URL's here in the thread) while we are working on getting your MW login straightened out.That's great that this project will be finished up soon!Now, as to getting you logged in:  if you will please see this document:https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BxWB83bbALTQM203NVRUUHFwZXM/edit?pli=1Could you tell me at which step it stops working for you, which browser you are using (for example Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari), and which operating system your computer has (Windows 7, Mac, etc)?If I'm not able to tell you how to get past the glitch, I'll call in assistance.
