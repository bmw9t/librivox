I think I saw some kind of PL note on section 3 earlier today when I was in the computer lab, did you remove it? I assume all complete sections are PL OK. which is awesomeSo if you looked at the MW you may have been confused when you saw broken links on the incomplete sections. I'll activate those links when I get them uploaded and done. The uploader generates those filenames automatically anyway, so I thought I could just plug it in and it'll work right away. The purpose is just to save a bit of work because I don't like to log on here, move from window to window, then copying and pasting. I sometimes forget about that step:]
