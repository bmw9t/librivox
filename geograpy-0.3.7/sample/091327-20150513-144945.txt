Hello Felipe! Welcome here!Yes, everything is great with your recording setup   When I open your file in Audacity, I see quite a thick line for where silence (thin line) should be, but indeed I can't hear anything, so it must be frequencies our ears don't catch. So no need to do anything, but if you feel like it, you could experiment with noise removal, to remove this ...silent noise   Either way, you're ready for the real thing!
