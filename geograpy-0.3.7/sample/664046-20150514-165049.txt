Thanks Satu!      The pleasure is mine.

As for the ID3 tags, I'm curious what I may have done wrong, but will surely keep a closer
eye on things as we progress.

I uploaded chapter 50, however it needs to be re-done.  My last 'save' didn't take properly,
and I uploaded it before giving it that final listening to.  (A real no-no).   

So you'll find a chapter 50 in the uploader, but it'll be re-uploaded later in the day (hopefully).

To be perfectly clear on the chapter numbering, chapter LIII (53) on the Virginia.edu web site
will be recorded as chapter 50.  Correct?
I might also point out that there are a number of other typos in the text, which I'm trying my best
to read as I believe they should be.  Audiary license?   

Thanks again, as a relative newbie here, the encouragement is much appreciated.
