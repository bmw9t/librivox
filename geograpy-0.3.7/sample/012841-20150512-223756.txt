Hey! I'm Casey from Arizona! I love books and found this cool website through iTunes. I'm still a highschooler, but will be graduating soon! I also go to Chandler-Gilbert Community college, and this semester I am starting Mythology! I'm so excited! If you want to start a book, feel free to invite me to help with it!
