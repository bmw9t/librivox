Well, Jo and Joy, the edits are complete and it looks like we may have another ham ready for the smokehouse.  Thanks so much for your work on this fun little project.  

Although George Washington Ogdon was not one of the literary giants of the early 20th Century, this was an enjoyable little novel, and I hope listeners pick up on it.  After all it was made into a movie.

Thanks again for getting this one out there.
