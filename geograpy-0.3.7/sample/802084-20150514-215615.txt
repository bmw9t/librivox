Annise has been doing all the heavy lifting on it, administratively.I'd kind of like to interview people and ask them "Why that bit?  You could have read anything, so why that particular piece?"Does it seem too parochial for a podcast?Not at all, Timothy! I think it would be a great feature of what has gone on in this LibriYear (Aug 10, 2011 - now). what do you think? Would you like to get that ready for the anniversary podcast coming out on Friday? Or would that be too soon? It would have to be to me by Wednesday. So probably too soon for that?Algy Pug's doing a special podcast on The Rubaiyat due out Aug 18. After that I have none scheduled, but some ideas planned.Do you have enough material to do an entire podcast devoted to Australia's National Year of Reading? If that's what you are thinking, I think that would be a great idea. You could host yourself or co-host with Anne or get Algy involved, since he will have hosted two by then.Let me know what you want to do and thank you so much for contributing ideas and segments to the podcasts!Cheers,Bob
