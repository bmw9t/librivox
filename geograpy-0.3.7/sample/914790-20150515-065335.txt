Failure to Launch is running here right now. I might go if I'm in desperate need of some light entertainment... we are rather reliant on our cinemas here. In the UK we had a DVD hire within walking distance, and we got amazon for rent DVDs through the post. Here, there's no such thing, and we haven't managed to join a video shop yet. The market sells lots of DVDs for a couple of dollars each, obviously not licensed... we don't have television... we're bored with the films we have at home...

So on to the cinema. In Valletta, there's a multiplex at one of the shopping centres, which attracts the usual crowd of people who don't switch off their phones and then *answer* the bloody things and talk for a while, before calling off, giggling teenagers, popcorn and taco crunchers, etc. Then there's the alternative, in the arts centre. Mostly mature crowd, indie films, no food, no talking and, best of all, no intermission! The multiplex has intermissions, which is ghastly.

The joys of island living... :)
