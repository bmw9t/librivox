Hello Jackie, and welcome to LibriVox!You're already heading in the right direction, with the reading and one minute test - but no need to tremble in fear - it's not an audition, just a check on your 'tech specs' to save possible frustration (and wasted hours )  later on!Your welcome e-mail also included a link to Phil's videos, which go a long way in removing the mystery regarding all the editing stuff.Have fun   Carol
