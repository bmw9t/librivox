sweet_byrd: Thank you! She's all yours.
Yes, read what's highlighted (look at the lines around it to see what mood your character should be in, if they should be shouting or whispering etc) and follow any stage directions you find.
And my advice would be to ham it up as much as possible - especially in this case.
Miss Avarice: Yes please, follow any stage directions you find. And read your lines keeping Alice's current mood in mind. A few sniffles before and during the dialogue would not be at all out of place.
