Downloaded chaps. 33 & 34. Here are more PL notes.

Chapter 20:
 1:04:   "belated" ("just starting--belated--for the train")
 3:35:   "but" instead of "and" ("the mounts were provided, but")
 6:59:   "frontiers" ("by the quarantine-bars on the frontiers")
The following, though a PG error, is "counter" in first Google book & "counter" is also used at 9:37, so I think this is an error in second Google book (I wouldn't change it if it were me): 8:26: "center" ("everybody crowded to the center") 
 9:32:   Add "me" ("show me the hand-baggage"; PG doesn't have "me")
10:53:  "I" ("and as if I did not mind")

Only has 4 seconds at the end; add 1 more second. 

Chap. 21:
 0:24:   In TOC leave a short silence between "Pudding with Arsenic" and "Revenge" (PG error; there is a long dash between those two; PG doesn't have a dash)
 0:55:   "fat" ("it is a fat wooden cigar")
 6:51:   Add "a" ("man do you a wrong" if you think it's important enough)
11:03:  Add another "Nie" ("At Nie Nie station"; PG only has one "Nie")
16:04:  "prejudices" ("risen above the prejudices of his caste")

Chap 22:
 1:02, etc.: "Rolf Boldrewood" (not "Ralph") & "Gordon" (not "Cordon"; PG has wrong names)
 1:54:   "facts" (PG has singular; should be plural: "coward, there are a thousand facts to prove it")
 6:09:   "comes" ("and comes straight for the mark" instead of "becomes")
 7:59:   "Mr. Eyre" (not Mrs.) ("Sir George Grey and Mr. Eyre")
 8:28:   "keep" ("How did they keep that sand-pipe")
10:22:  Delete "had" after "has"? (Although it's in first Google book, so it's up to you; "it is not likely that he has his equal")

Add 1 more second at end; there are only 4 seconds of silence. 

Chap 23 (not PG):
 1:23:   "horizonless" ("but a horizonless ocean of vivid green grass" instead of "horizontal")
 2:21:   "impressionist" (instead of "impressionistic"; "the other an impressionist picture")

Add 1 more second of silence at end; has 4. 

That's it for now, but more to come in the next day or so. Hope you're having a great week!
