Oh, yes, I am aware that Phantom Toll Booth isn't one that I can record for LibriVox, though I could put it in my will that my son should upload it when it is eligible - oooo... wouldn't that be something?  I too will be over 100 in 2057... though since I plan to live to 110, I should still be kicking around in 2057, but just barely... or, maybe I should say I'll be kicking but not walking... teeheehee... I'm going to record Phantom Toll Booth for JP and put it on cd for him... then I'm gonna look around for something to record for Drew (he's the older one)... Perhaps, in doing these I can get good enough to do others... as many recorded books as I have from other sources, I just can't believe that I haven't found you all sooner... I know this must be heaven....   <><
