HI Geoffrey, 

so the MW is in place. I have added the following tags: Non-fiction, classics (antiquity), philosophy. Do you think there's anything else relevant? 

Your ID3 tags can be a bit confusing if you have several sections starting with Chapter 1-3 - people may think like...'what, but I've heard that already?'. May I suggest to turn book and chapter around: 

01 - Book I, Chapters 1-3

Everything else is fine. Let's stay here for a day or two, maybe we find an interested DPL'er... 

Enjoy!
