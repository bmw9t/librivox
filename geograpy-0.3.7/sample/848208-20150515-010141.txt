Praise for icyjumbo (icyjumbo (1964-2010)) via the 'Thank a reader' feature:Quote:Greetings from Canada.    I justed wanted you to know how much I've enjoyed your reading of Tom Brown's School Days. I am half through the listening of this wonderful work. I really appreciate the fact that you've read the work in its entirety. On occasion when I listen to a work with several readers, I find certain readers who bring veracity to the reading and then they're gone. This creates difficulty in the listening. Another slight annoyance for me is a Canadian or American reading a chapter of Dickens and getting the pronunciations or dialects all wrong.    I hope you don't mind me saying that your clear, concise, unhesistating and honest rendering of this work and your fine accent has made a pleasure of listening.    Thank you very much.Ken P.S.My father's name was George Arthur born in Canada as was my great-grandfather's name born in Shropshire in 1833. Hearing this name brought a comfort.Tom Brown's School DaysAll of Icyjumbo's recordings
