 The Republic by Plato (424/423 BC - 348/347 BC)  Translated by Benjamin Jowett (1817 - 1893).This project is now complete! All audio files can be found on our catalog page: http://librivox.org/the-republic-version-2-by-plato/ Quote: The Republic is a Socratic dialogue written by Plato around 380 BC concerning the definition of justice and the order and character of the just city-state and the just man. It is Plato's best-known work and has proven to be one of the most intellectually and historically influential works of philosophy and political theory. In it, Socrates along with various Athenians and foreigners discuss the meaning of justice and examine whether or not the just man is happier than the unjust man by considering a series of different cities coming into existence "in speech", culminating in a city (Kallipolis) ruled by philosopher-kings; and by examining the nature of existing regimes. The participants also discuss the theory of forms, the immortality of the soul, and the roles of the philosopher and of poetry in society (Summary by Wikipedia) Target completion date: 2012-Jan-31 Text source (only read from this text!): http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/150 Type of proof-listening required (Note: please read the PL FAQ): standardIMPORTANT - soloist, please note: in order to limit the amount of languishing projects (and hence the amount of files on our hard-pressed server), we ask that you post an update at least once a month in your project thread, even if you haven't managed to record anything.
