And, we're at it again!   18 is fixed and uploading now. Thanks for hearing that "UNexpected" one. That one was tricky to catch!  I've gotten a cold. They say it's a myth that they come on with a change of weather, but why does it always seem to happen that way?   So I probably won't be recording more until the cold is under control. *sneeze* *cough* *sniffle*
