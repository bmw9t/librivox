It is a hoot ... a humorous very-tongue-in-cheek examination of how to handle men (simple creatures that we are, poor souls all).  Kind of like Dorothy Parker, only 40 years earlier.  Think of putting an article in Cosmopolitan and sending it to a wittier, more urbane and less jaded era for a re-write ... DROOOOOOOOOOOOL!!!  Sign me up.(btw -- I read Yellow Wallpaper in college -- creepy!  And I saw Repulsion!  I'd forgotten about that movie.  Shudder.  Meat.  Thanks for reminding me 

So you remember Catherine DeNeuve, right around the same time she made another wonderfully macabre film, Luis Bu√±uel's Belle du Jour?

I hope you or Caet or any woman jumps on _Yellow Wallpaper_.  Sign up.  It is, as you say, totally creepy ... and needs a listenership, but especially a feminine voice to read it.

As for _The Spinster Book_, all it needs is a BC.  I did _Awakening_, but I think more of us need to sign up for gender-specific books to BC.  I have more ideas after these.
