Hi Jothi! I'm afraid I can't answer these questions. I'm not very Audacity knowledgable yet! I recently found out about "Show clipping" myself!  I don't record often, so I still learn something new each time I do! I don't know of a way to deal with distortion caused by clipping...Here's the article about "Find clipping" in Audacity's manual: http://manual.audacityteam.org/o/man/find_clipping.htmlMaybe it helps!You may also post questions in the Need Help? Got Advice? forum, or, if you feel comfortable using the search function of the forum, you might even find questions that have already been answered!
