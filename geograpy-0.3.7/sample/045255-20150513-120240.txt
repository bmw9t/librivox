Ok, new thought.If anyone would like to BC these plays, or any other that I've suggested, please be my guest! I don't think I'll have the time to BC a christmas play this year, because the Dramatic Reading of Phantom of the Opera, launching in October, is my number one priority (it is my favourite book of all time!) Maybe if there's a one act play collection between now and Christmas, I'll put on or two of these in  there.To clarify: I can not BC a Christmas play this year, but if anyone can, please do! I'd also like to mention the multilingual "sound" play drama thing-y (I'm good at describing things) over here: Simultan Krippenspiel
