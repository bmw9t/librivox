I think you said something like "add whatever you like" somewhere.  See wikiRuthRuth.  Could you clarify that a bit?  I certainly don't want to contribute to spam in any way but I'm not really sure what external links you mean.  All of the videos so far have been uploaded You Tube so the links do lead there.  Is that it?    Anyway, let me know so we can nip any potential problem in the bud.
