Essentially you're saying that your computer crashed, now you're trying to fix it, right? 

And now, Quicktime says 'you need another version to save' rather than 'there's not enough space to save', right? 

Options: If you had a computer crash, you should run some sort of disc cleanup. Many anti-virus programs have that. Corrupted files may cause any type of troubles. If problem persists, try reinstalling Quicktime. 

Maybe that helps?
