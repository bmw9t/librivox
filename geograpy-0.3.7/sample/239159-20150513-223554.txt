Hey, Kirk--I'm going to mention one note for you on that final section just because it really changes the meaning of the phrase--Section 12:--At ~ 7:38 the text shows "They are interested in raising the general level of morality..."--but I hear "They are interested in raising the general level of mortality..."Also, I will mention that there were no ID3 tags for the final three sections (10,11,12)--but if I understand correctly, you do not need to be concerned about it as they will all be auto-filled when the project is cataloged.  If you understand otherwise, let me know!
