Hi all - I'm just getting started with recording and I could use your input. It seems that though I've managed to keep pops/plosives in line that I still have some sibilance going. 

I intend to set up a filter for any future recordings and I'm wondering if this one needs RE-recording... or if it's decent enough for a first go.

If it's better for me to to post this in the Help Me Please area, I'm happy to do that and thought that this could be a shortcut to supplying my entry if it is deemed acceptable. 

Once we determine the status of this version (and a new recording made if necessary), you can credit me as Kimm Viebrock with web address of http://www.soaringmountain.com

Thanks!

Best Regards,
