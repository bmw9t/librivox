http://archive.org/details/poviestiirazska00chekgoog    Hi, there, I am new here and I've spent 3 days to find books in Russian. Chocoholic, as you say chocoholic wrote:we usually can use them only if they are direct scans of books published in 1922 or earlier. it is allowed to read the book I found, but only "read on-line" and the second one "pdf-file". Am I right?  The second question is "can I read just ONE story (not a chapter) from the whole book which is called "Novels and stories"?
