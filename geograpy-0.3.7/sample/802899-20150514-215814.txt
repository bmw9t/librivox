IMPORTANT! DEAR TRANSLATORS

As you can see there is un-translated content on the portal pages.I need you please, to all translate this: 

Quote:Pages translated into Portuguese/French/Spanish/Finnish/Dutch/Italian/... We are on the way to translate important parts of our website to several languages. Please understand that this is work-intensive and difficult to keep the translated pages as current as the original version. Moreover, it is unavoidable that links from the translated websites mostly point to english pages.

No need to go Wiki on this.
