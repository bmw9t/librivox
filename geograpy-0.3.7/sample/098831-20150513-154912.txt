Jessie,We will need some keywords before cataloguing.  They will be words that you imagine somebody might put in a search engine if they were looking for this book or something like it.  You have lots of time to think about it.I'm surprised that you have no claims yet.  Some of the stories are very long and this could be putting people off.  Would you consider splitting the longer ones into two sections?  Have a look at the other two versions:http://librivox.org/the-jungle-book-by-rudyard-kipling/http://librivox.org/the-jungle-book-by-rudyard-kipling-2/for an idea of how it has been done. If you decide to you can add sections yourself and rearrange the titles.You don't need to copy that exactly but I think you'll get more interest with shorter sections.  We also need our files to be no longer than 70 minutes and especially the 8995 count will be pushing that limit.
