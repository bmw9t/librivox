I know the Christmas season is a long ways off. But I'm starting to think about ways to distribute our Christmas Carol Collection as CDs during the Holiday Season -- it's a nice, "home-made" sort of gift.

I originally thought of sending them out to soldiers overseas. Check out this website for ideas:

From reading another post, I got the idea to send CDs to prisoners. I wasn't able to find much information on how to do that. Any help would be helpful ;-) !

Feel free to leave any ideas!
