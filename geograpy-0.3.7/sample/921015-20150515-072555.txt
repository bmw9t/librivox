I honestly don't think it's worth it. You can find plenty of text-to-speech created audio recordings at Gutenberg, and I even found a website the other day that was giving for free, text-to-speech recordings of public domain texts. I'm not saying that your supervisor should do this at all, I just don't think that LibriVox is the place for those recordings.
