I'll try to get that done in the next 24 hours. Please let me know if you do still need a reader. Thanks! KatekatesternerHi Kate! Welcome to Librivox! You are on the right track! Once you get an OK on your test, you can start recording! I'm going to add you into that box on the first page that we call the Magic window. Here are some helpful videos that I benefited a lot from when I first joined LV.  Thanks for claiming, it's so exciting to see a book full up! Enjoy your readings!Edit: How do you want to be added into the Catalog. Your real name or your forum name?
