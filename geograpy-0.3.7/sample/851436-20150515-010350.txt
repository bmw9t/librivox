Thank you Susan, that's very thoughtful of you.  The Honor of the Big Snows happens to bethe most meaningful Curwood novel to me, for reasons I need not go into here, and I was glad to have been able to record it for others.It's gratifying to hear that there are others who enjoy this work as well.  Thank you again!     It means a lot to me that you got out of it that which was put into it.  It's Curwood that deserves the kudos.The Librivox team merely brought it to the public in its own unique way.
