Greetings.  Andria, I feel your pain.  I am a newbie, too, so I appreciate your asking the question.  I also tried to upload my first 1-minute test, and everything was going great until I tried to copy the URL.  The 'copy' button was not highlighted. I was able to play my recording via Quicktime, but when I tried to go back to manually write down the URL, it was gone.  So I will try to upload again today and see what happens.
Does anyone know why the 'copy' button would not work at this step, or how I can do a work-around'?  Thanks

Halley
