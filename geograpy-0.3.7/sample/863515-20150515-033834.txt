Oh, blither it, looking at the twisty flow diagram of doom, I totally got the future prediction wrong.


Works published in 1923 expire in 2019, and then there's an annual crop from then on, right up until 2073 (1977's books.)

And overlapping with that, the Life+70 thing kicks from 1978's deaths onward, so, the work of people who died in 1978 becomes public domain in 2049.

If it wasn't 11pm, I could come up with some lovely examples of the craziness of this system, and the weird lengths of protection things will receive, but it's late and perhaps someone else can play with that.
