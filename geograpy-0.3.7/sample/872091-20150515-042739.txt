Marvelous!

Suspecting it's a completely open wiki. Any one who can, can (and will.)

Will it take a lot of constant monitoring to brush off the self-promoters and retailers/wholesalers?

Will scrutinize it carefully over the next few days and report back on specifics that raise worthy questions â€”if any. Hopefully you're giving this a little time before it "goes live" or have major scrutiny chiefs scoured and polished it already?

Very good idea. Congrats!
