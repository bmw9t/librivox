Okay, gang.  I'm putting together text files for each section which I will then either upload to the server space and provide links, or just e-mail them directly to the volunteer.

I will actually put the intros, disclaimers, and "Letter ##" "End of Letter ##" and other such things into the actual text file to make things easier for reading.  I will do something to the font for what I add to distinguish it from the orginal content just as an FYI.

I should have these ready in the next couple days, so until then just sit tight a bit longer!
