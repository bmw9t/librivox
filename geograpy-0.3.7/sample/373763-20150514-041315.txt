Thank you Ruth,It's taken a long time, but at last I no longer fear the microphone, which should speed up recording somewhat!....and I am learning so much.  Just need to concentrate harder on learning about autohotkeys (my eyes glaze over as I try to get through the 1st paragraph of the online tutorial (*will ask Phil if he'd consider doing one). Once I know how to use those, my editing time might become days instead of weeks!Thank you Elli, for downloading - and thank you both for your patience!CarolETA: *Oh, I see he already has, dashing off to watch it now!
