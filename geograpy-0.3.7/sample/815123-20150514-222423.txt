Whenever I edit, I grab as little as possible of the non-speaking waveform for each character line as I move it up to the master file (which should start with a uniform background - ie, narrator or I use an Audacity-generated low level white noise if the narration is not submitted yet when I start to edit).  That doesn't help for any character background that creeps in between that character's words, but it does prevent going from one person's background to another person's background before the new words start.I actually prefer noise cleaned files before I edit cuz to clean you need a sample of a specific person's background to remove the noise properly.  Since each background is different, I don't see how waiting until they are assembled to clean actually works well.  So I clean each character file before I start if necessary - like if I have to amplify someone a lot and that makes their background noise really, well, really noisy.  I guess that having non-cleaned files submitted at least ensures that files have not been OVER-CLEANED which is worse that being a bit unclean. Thanks, Todd
