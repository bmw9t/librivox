Done some more listening:

Section 2: Great reading David. Noted the MP's name missing from the into, as in section 1. IMO this is a very minor and ignorable error, but it's up to you if you want to correct it.

Section 5: Great reading, Sibella.

Section 9: Great reading, Philippa,  but I had to turn it up higher than ususal. Does it need amplification? Not entirely sure.
