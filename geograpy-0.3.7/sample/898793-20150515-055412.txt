A quick note to say that its quite flattering to have one of my reads chosen by the book club.  It was my first LV recording ever, so pardon my mistakes.I'm not sure the chapters which are just lists of books make for the most scintilating of listens.  I enjoyed readng them, as I was mentally ticking them off as I went, to see how many I'd read or listened to.  So if the listening time is a bit long, you might skip those three chapters, or just sample them.Bennett's an interesting bird.  I'm a librarian, and his idea that everyone should have a personal library of great works seems to have gone from fashionable to deeply unfashionable as a generation marker amongst literary critics, to a sort of superceeded anachronism in modern thinking, and now it seems to be sneaking back with the invention of the Kindle and the Ipad, since a bundle of all the texts that Bennett suggested could just be put in each one, or cloudlinked, for free.I also think his philosophy that enjoying literature is about reclaiming the persistent interestingness of life is a great thing for a modern librarian to be reminded of, because its easy to be suckered into meeting our profession's methods of measuring success, without remembering that the map's not the terrain, and that the measurement systems were designed back when ballpoint pens were revolutionary.
