David, here's what I'm thinking of for the summary...

Francis, a young Italian boy, is a merchant's son who is enthralled by the troubadour songs and tales of knights that his father brings back from his travels. He decides to become a knight, but after seeing the poor and suffering in the tragedies of war, he decides to give away all of his worldly possessions and become a troubadour for God.

Any critique? I'm off to setup a PL thread.
