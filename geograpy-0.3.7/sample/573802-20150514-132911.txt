Hi Kartik. Welcome to LibriVox!

I'm afraid this project has a Dedicated Proof-Listener, who has agreed to check all the sections of the project (projects that have a DPL will have a "this project has a dedicated proof-listener" comment near the top of the Magic Window).

You can also find projects that don't have a DPL by looking at this table. Look for 'no's in the far right column.
