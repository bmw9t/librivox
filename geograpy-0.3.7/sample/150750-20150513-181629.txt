See here: http://www.howjsay.com/index.php?word=liege&submit=Submit (I prefer the 2nd pronunciation, as this is a French-derived word.)Also, please note that the filename of Chapter 5 does not include the 128kb at the end.No problem -- I'll download chapter 5 today, insert the correctly pronounced word, and re-upload.  Thanks!ETA: Done.
