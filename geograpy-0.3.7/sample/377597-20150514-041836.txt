Anyone have an idea what it is?http://upload.librivox.org/share/uploads/ek/roaringgirl_JDapper_5.mp3 It sounds like you may have applied too much noise cleaning to your file. It is best to apply a couple of lower value NR passes than one large one.These are the values I use...Noise Reduction (db) - 8Frequency smoothing - 100Attack/decay time - 0.11..and remember to take a new "noise sample' before each NR pass.
