Hi and welcome!I'm from SE England too, and just joined on 1st March.My three daughters are older than you, but I still feel 24yrs, and look more like Twiggie (I hope!!) than an old grandmother!! My middle daughter's twin girls are 6 months old.Warning - this site is addictive!  I'm really enjoying it, though haven't made my first recording yet.Enjoy!Carol
