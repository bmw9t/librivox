Hi there,
In fact, Palliser's talk of decimalisation was very reflective of the time. Many times throughout the Victorian Period and the early 20th century, various Lords raised the issue in the House of Lords, and it was heavily discussed, but for some reason it was just never passed. They got the idea because the French decimalised in the 19th century--maybe it didn't pass because they didn't want to seem to copy the French quite so much. The fact that it appears in a novel though shows how literature was then regularly used as a medium to spread ideas to the population. May I please sign up for sections 35, 36, and 37?

Thanks,
