Dave,Here are the readings I have done in Librivox so far.  I do not see a pattern in them as you describe, but in Chance and this one so far, yes.  But it was just by accident as I did not know what the story was at all about. In Chance the heroine was very much a victim while in Pastor's Wife she seems so far mostly to be a comedian and satirist. I just enjoyed the author's style in the first few pages.Glad you are back.JCarsonCelibatesChanceConfessions of a ConvertEchoes of the WarFather SergiusHighwaymanHis FamilyIrish Wit and HumorJourney to LisbonNaval War of 1812Pastor's WifeWreck of the Golden Mary
