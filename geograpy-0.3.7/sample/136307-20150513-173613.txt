I PL'd section 2. Todd can listen for enjoyment later. 12:51 - After "the soldiers press round him" I hear catrose's voice saying  "To the Netherlands they would lend us now—" then  back to 1st Cuirassier saying " 'Tis what none need be wondrous glad to learn. To the Netherlands..." I think what needs to happen is 12:51-12:58 should be cut out: Catrose saying "To the Netherlands they would lend us now—" to and including Algy's second "'Tis what none need be wondrous glad to learn."25:45-25:42 - extra lines "Here now alone, so teach us who can  how must we may meet and mar their plan" don't belong there31:42 - missing the lines from above: "Here now alone, so teach us who can  how must we may meet and mar their plan" Most of the stage directions on individual lines are not read, but a couple are (such as "FIRST ARQUEBUSIER (To the Sutler-woman, drawing out his leather purse).") Did you mean to leave most of them out?
