"Chapter 19 OK" --Do you mean chapter 10?

I have two more chapters nearly complete and will submit soon.

Then on May 22 my wife will be leaving on an Amtrak trip to Chicago and Council Bluffs, where I will be doing 3 days of research in the Union Pacific Museum.  I'm planning to write an intensively researched book on the history of railroads in Union County, Oregon, where we live.

Back to Librivox in June.
