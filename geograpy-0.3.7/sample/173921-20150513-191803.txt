PL section 14 OK. It is a tiny bit low in volume, but that can be fixed in the process of cataloguing, I believe.Adrian, I think you do very well at making this text accessible to the listener (and, to be sure, it is the most complicated text I have PL'ed, too, but I have to say it is growing on me!). In my opinion it works well re-read the first half of the sentence after that very long footnote in the middle of the sentence around 5 minutes in, and with your use of inflection/reading style etc it is not hard to follow you.    Well done!
