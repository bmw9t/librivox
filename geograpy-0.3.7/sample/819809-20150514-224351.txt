I have disabled my computers own built in microphone and plugged my zoom into it when I started recording. I checked from Audacity preferences and device seems to be right ("H4 microphone" it says). It should  be right? This is the situation and still the input volume is too low :/ Quality was commented to be good so I can increase volume by amplifying, but I wonder is there still something I could do for it?
