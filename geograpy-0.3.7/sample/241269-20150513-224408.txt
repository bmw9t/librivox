Kim,Yes, I think it's one of the most perfect endings to a book I've ever come across. The last line is perfect. I read it about 6 times so I could be sure I could give it the justice it deserves.  I think there's some comfort in the passages about square pegs ending up being another kind of specialness once out in the world. We do feel hopeful for Laura, and that is important in life generally, I think.I have already started a new solo, Bush Studies by Barbara Baynton, but I don't think the timing is right for you at the moment.  Nevertheless, thank you for your kind words about my reading; I'll be doing more solos, definitely, so you may well get a DM from me.  And, yes! You should do another solo, if you have the time.All the best, Kirsty
