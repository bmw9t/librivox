Hi Sally!Chapter 5: there is also some background noise! (otherwise it's great)I hear a kind of buzz throughout the recordings... especially at the very beginning. It sounds like computer fan noise. I guess some noisecleaning should do the trick.Yeah, I was refering to the chapter title. If there is no chapter title we usually put in "01 - Chapter 1" or something like that.
