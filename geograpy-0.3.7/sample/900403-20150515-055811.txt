I'm already wondering when I should upgrade & what would be the best mic to upgrade to--and with limited space around my computer & bed (where I basically spend all my time), perhaps I need a mic stand?? Right now I have to lean down rather uncomfortably to record. Hmm. Any ideas, anyone? I'm definitely open to help! In fact, HELP!!   Me! 

I use a Zoom H2 on a boom mic stand that swivels over my bed so I can record in peace.
