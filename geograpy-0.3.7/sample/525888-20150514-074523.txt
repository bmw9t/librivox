Welcome Aperi =) I'll sign you up for section 27. How would you like your name to appear in the catalog? Do you have a URL you would like associated with your name?

For the modern version, simply write it out, but don't record/read it. We're only recording the original text as it was printed. The modern version is just a fun thing that we're doing as obsessed knitters and posting the modern instructions to the KnitWiki.

If you have other questions, don't hesitate to ask us here... Enjoy your section =)
