Great work!  Just some minor hiccups, but nothing too serious:4:00 - "Steps for a moment to look at the prisoner" (should be "Steps for a better look at the prisoner")6:46 - "starts into speech" (should be "startled into speech")9:16 - "pause in which" ("a pause in which" -- although that might be minor enough to ignore)To everyone else--are we allowed to excise certain stage directions from our these audio productions?  This play obviously has a lot of stage direction, and some of it -- when read aloud -- could potentially ruin the comic timing.  I'm specifically thinking of descriptions of how certain lines should be delivered:Shielded One (firmly): I would.Lawyer (weakly): You would?If the performers read their lines in a firm and weak fashion, do I need to include the stage directions?  Or should it be included for the sake of word-for-word faithfulness to the source material?
