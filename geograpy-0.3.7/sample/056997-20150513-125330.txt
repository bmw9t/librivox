- Thanks for changing the file name to a shorter format - on my list to do.- Since I've had to divide the long chapters into smaller sections, I've change the intro and outro to reflect this.   Does this format look okay?-Magic Window is complete, so I think we are ready to move over to Readers Wanted.Thanks again for your help.
