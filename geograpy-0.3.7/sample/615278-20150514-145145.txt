Well, I read Penrod and Penrod and Sam when I was in the third grade...several times.  Recently I was back in the states for my mother's funeral, and I met up with the girl (now woman) who recommended to me that I read Penrod in the first place, and it reminded me of the book, and I said, "Ah this would surely be librivox material..." I have been long looking for something American and humorous to read..."  And there was no Tarkington on Librivox when I started.  Hopefully, thanks to my initial effort, this really great writer (and congressman) will come into more people's awareness.
