i have uploaded revised chapters 8, 14, 15 & 16.  in chapter 16 i think i have removed the panting.   if it still could use improvement, please let me know.  i'll use headphones so i can better hear the audio.  Thank you MaxineMarie for helping out!  it is great to see you again, too.  Rapunzelina, we leave dec 12th.  i will become increasingly busy and making trips to the head honcho's house before then. i may be gone later this week or over the weekend only or who knows.  it is possible i am available until the 10th. i really don't know.   by the way, the official invite didn't happen until last weekend.  Thank you for your help!
