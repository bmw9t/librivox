I mean, they would want to make some money out of it, and if you decrease the time they have to do so, well...It's possible, but there's also a limit to how much people would be willing to pay for the creations so they wouldn't set the price higher than that, and assuming the creators don't all collude to fix prices (since that's illegal) there'll always be someone willing to sell their thing cheaper than everyone else which will force everyone else to lower their prices as well. I think creative industries where there's always a ton of competition are one of the few places where capitalism actually works really well.I also wish we would build some sort of creative commons licensing into the copyright law where creators can specify how they want their work to be used. I work as a videographer and photographer and release almost all of my works under some sort of creative commons license, but I still often get people e-mailing me that want to use my work but won't because they are either nervous about or unfamiliar with how the CC license works.
