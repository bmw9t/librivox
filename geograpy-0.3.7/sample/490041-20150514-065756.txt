Hi Elynn,You have a few spikes in your recording which prevent amplifying. These are called plosives, caused by breath sounds into the mic on the 'p' and 't' type sounds. try using the mic to one side of your mouth.You can increase volume with the recording sofware or your computer's system controls. Please post if you need more help.
