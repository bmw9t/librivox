Now, let's summarize:
- we shouldn't let females read text by male authors (and vice versa)
- we shouldn't let British read American authors (and vice versa)
- we shouldn't let non native speakers read at all

and last but not least we should make absolutely sure that voice and reading style pleases ALL our listeners.

Hm. Not much left.
Maybe we should just close the doors and do something else?
Or we could listen to the other 99% of our listeners and go on recording?
