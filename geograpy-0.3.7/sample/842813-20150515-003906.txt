Denny - some good points there. The easiest solution to me would seem that if a BC doesn't have server space and uses an MC's server to back up the files (and to enable easy access for proof-listening), that the BC asks readers (again only those who don't link to their own server space) to upload directly to the MC's server. This would save the BC one upload. For those readers who still prefer to use a free server such as Mediafire, YSI, etc, they can post the links and then the BC has to download and upload to the MC's server (but the details should be noted in the first post then).

In other words, a flowchart would look like this:
BC has server space:if it has an uploader, ask readers (add to point 8. BC template) to upload there unless they have own server spaceif it doesn't have an uploader, leave BC template as is and download from Mediafire etc and upload files to your server yourself.BC doesn't have server space but MC does:if it has an uploader, ask readers (add to point 8. BC template) to upload there unless they have own server spaceif it doesn't have an uploader, leave BC template as is and download from Mediafire etc and upload files to MC's server yourself via ftp.BC doesn't have server space and MC also doesn't: PM an MC with an uploader and ask for a sub-folder, and follow step 2. above.
I'll put this into the BC instructions in the wiki at some point.

I wasn't aware that some Uploaders fill up, I hope mine doesn't have that problem. ftp is a good option but holds security risks for the server owner, and requires a learning curve for readers who don't know it - that's why we created the uploaders in the first place.
