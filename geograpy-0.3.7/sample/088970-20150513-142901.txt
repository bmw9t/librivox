Hello, Emily! Welcome to Librivox!Nice equipment!   Tech specs correct   You have a steady volume, but it's too quiet at ~80dB. Target volume is around 89-90dB. Check if you can increase the microphone's input volume, either from the Control Panel for sounds and microphone's, or from the microphone slider in Audacity. If those are maxed up, you might be able to use the "Amplify" effect in Audacity, but it's always nice when it's recorded within desired volume range in the first place. Increasing the input volume, or amplifying, may also bring up some background white noise, which should be easily dealt with the Noise Removal effect in Audacity.Try to make this adjustment and post in this thread again when ready with a new recording.
