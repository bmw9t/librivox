Oh, dear... now that you're on the edge of your seat I wanted to post my updates as to book #3, which has arrived and I have a 2nd hand scanner, and I think I did the correct pages the correct way but now I'm wondering what is next. Ann, do I zip them to you (now or later?) or do we need someone else to give the ok on that? Is there a dpi I should have gone with? I was just flying by the seat of my pants and went with whatever the machines were comfortable doing on their own, but I can do things over if I did it wrong. (Not even sure I know how to do a "zip".)(And of course let me know if I should have posted this elsewhere, but I figured we were all in it together, and even if not for the long haul, the interest of Peggy's next destination is currently here anyway.  )
