Sorry for my delay in responding... (real life happened when I wasn't looking again)

Starlite, kmerline, DigiSage, Thank you for updating the chapter list, proof-listening, and uploader support.

Martina, I'll let you know if/when we have orphaned chapters.

redabrus, Rowland, Ralph Snelson, lynvet33, Thank you for your chapters.

Aperi, simonevers, sorry about the uploader frustrations... as Starlite suggested, please go ahead and use a file hosting service like http://www.mediafire.com/ and post a link here on the forum. One of us will then pick it up and get it into the uploader for you. Thanks for your persistence =)

Moving this thread to Readers Found ... Did I miss anything?
