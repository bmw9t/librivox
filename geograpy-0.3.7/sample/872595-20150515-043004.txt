I think these are some of the works that were copyrighted before 1977 and did not have their copyright renewed, letting them fall into the US public domain. See the Copyright and Public Domain page on the wiki for a full explanation. 

We'd need a full check before they are given the greenlight, but most have been okay'ed by Project Gutenberg; manybooks.net gets most of their texts from Gutenberg.
