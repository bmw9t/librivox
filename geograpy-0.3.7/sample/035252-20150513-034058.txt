Pounce: Laila! Spanish, hmm? Would you mind proof-listening a chapter of Don Quijote Spanish, in the Listeners Wanted forum? Desperately need some help there of Spanish speakers in particular.

Another pounce: why not read a Grimms Maerchen (in Readers Wanted), in good ole German - short chapters, so good to start. Assuming you want to read in German; you might prefer English, which is fine of course.

Oh, and... welcome to LibriVox!
