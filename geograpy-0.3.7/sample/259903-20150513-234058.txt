As the backlog of PL work on both this project and Earth Spirit has now been cleared, and as catrose doesn't want to DPL, I may as well volunteer to DPL both plays. The bulk of the major roles are now done, and when it comes to PLing the compete edited acts , I would like to do that as I have become fascinated by these plays.alan
