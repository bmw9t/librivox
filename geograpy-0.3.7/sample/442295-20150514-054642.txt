If you decide to take me on, I'm quite happy to throw on a few different voices, so if you have ideas as to the types of voices you want for these three parts please let me know and I'll see what I can do!  If you prefer I can just have a play around and see what voices seem to best fit. I'd be happy to be in the catalog as Steve Belleguelle and my website is http://www.belleguelle.net Many thanks,  SteveHi Steve,Congratulations on your 1 minute test and welcome to LV.     I'll get you set up in the catalog. If you haven't done dramatics before please be sure to leave me a couple of seconds between lines so I can edit everything into place. If you do the readings all at the same time feel free to submit a single file instead of 1 file for each chapter just be sure to provide [role] read by Steve Belleguelle at the start of each chapter. Above all, enjoy the characters. After all how often do you get to be a talking Raven?   Linny
