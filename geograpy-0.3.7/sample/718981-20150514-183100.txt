Second LiQi poem done!

I looked at the other poems, and God they're long! LOL I'm too used to the usual 5/7 words, 4-line poems I learnt back when I was 4. Good thing there's pinyin to go with the text, 'cause I can't read half the words  

BTW, if you want, I can ftp the files up to your server; it'll save you some time.
