could someone check? 
Quote:Sir,I was trying to listen to Doyle's The Case of the Speckled Band (Adventures of Sherlock Holmes) and both mp3 versions stopped partway through and refused to go further. Perhaps they were simply taking a long time to buffer, but I couldn't get them to go on. I didn't check the ogg file. By that time I just went to reading it out loud to my children.I hope I've given enough information to help you find this problem.I also want to say Thank You! We really appreciate having these titles available to us. My daughter is reading Sherlock Holmes for a class, and listening to some of them helps her get through it all. She loves the stories, but reading everything can get hard at times.Thank you again.Lora R.
