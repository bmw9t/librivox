I don't think I am designated to do this.  You want fresh listeners.  But My notes are:1) It is in mp3 instead of flac.  (Unless I'm too goofy to remember how to download correctly.)2)  at 7:38-7:39 The Cowardly Lion inserts the word "the" in  "Don't say rest to me."  (It does change the meaning a bit.)3)  Later on (I've lost the place)  when Glinda says, "The Emperor of the Silver Island," I hear Seven instead of Silver.LET ME KNOW IF I CAN HELP THE PROJECT.Hi there Florence!  Welcome back.  Thanks for PLing chapter 6.  Drew seems to be busy at the moment, so I think you can help out.  Don't want to step on anyone's toes though.
