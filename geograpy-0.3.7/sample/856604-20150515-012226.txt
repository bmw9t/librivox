I know we are not there yet, but sub-categories would be a nice addition.
For instance, fiction in english produces over 800 results, but if I wanted only science fiction in english, it gets harder.  I didn't realize how hard until I saw the keyword list at archive.org for librivox and noticed these:
Sci Fi (1) Sci-fi (18) SciFi (1) Science (12) Science Fiction (26) Science-fiction (1) 
I'm having a terrible time hording all of the ancient sci-fi when these works are keyworded as so many different ways. Help.
