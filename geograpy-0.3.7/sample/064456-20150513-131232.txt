Also at 35:22.@36:37 there is a missing "crowd" cry of "Death to Fabiani! Fabiani!"The crowd scenes are really good - I just can't help noticing that it is an "all female" crowd. It sounds odd. How about I quickly record the crowd lines with my "male voice processing" on it, just to give it a bit of bass? Since you'll be editing it anyway.Yes, please do! I very much agree, which is why I tried putting Simon Renard into a couple of them. Would you mind doing the heralds as well?The problem is the Simon Renard says the line immediately before, so it sounds odd to have him "repeating himself" in the crowd. Also, Bob's voice is so distinctive you can't just slip him into the crowd!   I don't think you need any more heralds - there are only supposed to be two, and they are actually named as being characters. I think having any more people will just add to the confusion!(I'm away for the weekend but I'll make this top priority for when I get back on Monday!)Hehe, no, I noticed that too:P Okay, I'll edit him out and let it stand as is:)
