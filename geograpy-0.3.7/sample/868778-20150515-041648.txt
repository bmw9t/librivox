Problem with MSN/Yahoo etc is that they're individual logins - so you'd have to know the user name of each person you're trying to contact. A number of LV volunteers have their chat user names linked at the bottom of their posts - you'll find logos from Yahoo etc if they do. This can be set up in the Profile (see top of forum page). E.g. see the post above yours, kristin has one.
