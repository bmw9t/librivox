Hi Michele, I can't believe we're almost at the end, either.  It's been really a lot of fun and I like working with you. Hopefully, we can do more projects together in the future. Hope the heat wave isn't getting to you too much. But as you say, it's so nice to have some warm weather after the winter. It's been a lovely spring. I wish there was a way to attach some photos for you. I hope to get Chapter 24 off to you soon.  Thanks again for listening. Have a good day. Best wishes............Larraine.
