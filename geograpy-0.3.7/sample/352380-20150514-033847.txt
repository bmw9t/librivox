Here's another 1 minute test submitted with thanks and apologies for making this more agonizing than I'm sure you want.I have slowed my computer fan down so its less noisy and fiddled with the noise reduction settings in Audacity.  I'm certainly willing to keep trying although there's not much more I can do with my computer before the CPU burns out.http://upload.librivox.org/share/uploads/tests/test_rebcult.mp3
