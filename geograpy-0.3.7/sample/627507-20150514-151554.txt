Section 6 (Book 1 canto 5)  PL'd:



Outro needs Book number Outro needs titleNeeds 10 seconds added to end



6:35- suggest lowering the volume for the part that starts "ach! wretched son of woeful sire! ...". 
it's excellently read, but comes in louder than is comfortable (espcecially if using headphones) 

27:23- 27:33 "can night defray...(etc)"
an edit that has a drastic change of audio, tho not a change in volume. i don't know if it can be smoothed out or even if it matters.
