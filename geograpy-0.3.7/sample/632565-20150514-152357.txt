Jc - I'm going to promote this project on Twitter.  I don't know if that'll help, but it's worth a try!

I think you can also release Genecode's unread sections.  The hasn't been around since April last year.

I wonder whether we ought to split the Mandarin and Cantonese sections.  We might have a better chance of getting this completed if we only had one dialect to focus on.  What do you think?

Thanks!
