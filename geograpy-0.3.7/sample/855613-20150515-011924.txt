Usually I deal with test recordings on the Listeners and Editors Wanted forum, but as you asked... Bit rate, sample rate, volume and mono channel all correct. You have a high level of background noise. This may not be apparent to you as it is likely to be the same noise that your computer makes, and even if you are listening on headphones you may not be able to differentiate the noises from your computer and from your recording.The Audacity Noise Removal feature will deal with it successfully. Highlight a few seconds of background noise with no speech in it. Click Effect | Noise Removal and click 'Get Noise Profile'.Then select all (Ctrl+A) and click Effect | Noise Removal again. Enter these settings into the boxes:Noise reduction (dB): 8Sensitivity (dB): 4Frequency smoothing (Hz): 150Attack/decay time (secs): 0.1Then click OK.As you say, the chair creaks a lot throughout the recording, and we would normally expect readers to edit out other bangs, audible sniffs etc.Other than that, nice audio quality.
