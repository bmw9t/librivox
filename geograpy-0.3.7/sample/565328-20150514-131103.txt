Since it's your first recording, Create, I made sure to PL it. 

Well read. Was it you in another thread asking about reading too slowly? I didn't find this too slow at all, but a very nice pace.

There were 15 seconds of silence at the end; it only needed 5, since the recording is under 30 minutes. I went ahead and chopped 'em off and uploaded the corrected section, since that's the only edit that it needed.

It sounded a little tinny to me, like maybe you had done a bit too much noise cleaning. If you play with your noise cleaning settings a bit, maybe you could find a balance between removing the background noise and distorting the voice. Which version of Audacity are you using? The newest ones (1.3.x) have the best noise cleaning functions.

The sound was noticeable to me, but it isn't so bad that it requires fixing or re-recording. So the section is PL OK. Thanks!
