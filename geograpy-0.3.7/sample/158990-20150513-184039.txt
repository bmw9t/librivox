But, wait to record until after you get the OK on your one-minute test.  It will make your life much easier if we can make sure that your settings are where we need them to be before you record.  Would you like for me to put your real name, and/or a url/blog on your catalog page?Hi AnnYou can use my real name, Laurie Richards.And thanks for the direction. I'm hoping to get the OK shortly, and will get this done for you.Thanks!
