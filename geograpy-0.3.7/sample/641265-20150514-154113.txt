This is my first work for LibriVox (but I'm looking forward to more). I'd love to do Sections 15, 16, and 17. 

For cataloguing, my username is fine -- Beeber.

I understand you'd like to hear a quick reading as a technical check, since this will be my first submission. I'll get that to you shortly.

Also, how would you like me to handle the breaks for those inserted French passages?  Just a big pause in the file? Or should I say something like "Insert French passage here?"
