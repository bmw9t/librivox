See what you think:https://librivox.org/uploads/triciag/birdstories_15_burroughs_128kb_au2.mp3https://librivox.org/uploads/triciag/birdstories_16_burroughs_128kb_au2.mp3If they're acceptable, just change the links to these in the MW. I'll fix the file names at cataloging. I'm very sorry that Mickey is leaving.  I think that the sections processed through Auphonic sound good, Tricia.  Since there were no other PL notes (and assuming that Anusha has no objections), I've copied the links to the MW and marked them as PL OK.  Thank you for your help, Tricia--and thank you again, Mickey, for participating in this project.(Note: I also removed Mickey's claim for Section 17 while I was updating the links, so now we just have the chapter on "The Whip-poor-will" left to complete this lovely book!)
