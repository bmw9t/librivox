Sorry I feel kinda like I'm spamming this thread, but I have more questions. 

I'm currently using Double Knit Wool on 3.25mm needles and I've done half the back, currently it's seeming very small. Should I

a) continue knitting it anyway so that we can all at least see what it looks like?
b) switch to larger needles (say 4mm) with the same wool?
c) get a thicker wool on the 3.25mm needles?

I think the last two options will in theory make the pattern slightly bigger? But I'm not really sure :S
