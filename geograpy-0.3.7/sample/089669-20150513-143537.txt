It's in mono, and the volume is better!   Did you do any noise removal or normalization on this one? Noise removal: Here are a couple resources: text instructions: http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/Noisecleaning_With_Picsvideo: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFSg9o37HMwI think you can just do the following settings:Noise reduction: 10Sensitivity: 0Frequency Smoothing: 150Attack/decay: 0.03(The most important one is the Noise Reduction. You don't need much.)Other than that, you have a couple plosives. This is when your breath directly hits the microphone on letters like P, F, or TH. (You can hear it and see the spikes on "picked" and "pages" at 0:03, and "fable" at 0:04.) Move your microphone a little bit to the side of your mouth if a desktop mic, or a little above or below your mouth if a headset mic. This will help the air pass by the mic instead of directly hitting it.
