It is uploaded here http://upload.librivox.org/share/uploads/cm/sikhreligion1_03_macauliffe.mp3.Can I take section 2?SachinI am busy right now too, so my Librivox time is very limited!!  But I have you in for section 2.  Once you get the French recording just insert it into section 3 and re-upload.  Ask if you have any questions on how to do this!!One question I do have is that I take it that the person who does the French recording must send me all the files generated by Audacity rather than the finished mp3 file that can be created using Audacity?
