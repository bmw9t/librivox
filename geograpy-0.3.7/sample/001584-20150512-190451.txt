Hi While it's great that you've successfully recorded and uploaded the test, it would be better if you reposted it in a seprate thread in the "Listeners Wanted" section where it will be more visible  Once the test has been OKed you can go forth and contribute to any of the projects you can find in the sections called "Readers Wanted". Remember to read the first post in your chosen thread as it will include important info. If you would like to proof-listen newly-submitted sections search for projects with ~ in the header.Have fun
