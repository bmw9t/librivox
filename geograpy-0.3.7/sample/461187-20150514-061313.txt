The words "answer" and "it" run together, so I don't think I can edit it so that it wouldn't sound wonky and don't feel like re-recording it since I have allergies right now.  Hopefully it won't interfere with anyone enjoying the book too much.  I'm still editing Ch. 18.  It's an epic!GregFine by me for sure....
