Of course if these birds don't have perfect pitch next time, or you bring in a new batch of birds next time, you might need slightly different filter settings.This could be relatively quick and dirty - it sounds a lot more difficult than it really is, and once you get a routine, it would be just a few clicks.  The EQ settings can be saved and then it's applied to every file you produce, so its a matter of getting it set up the first time (assuming the birds don't change their frequencies very often - then it might be time to think about firearms   ).How about recording at night?Dennis
