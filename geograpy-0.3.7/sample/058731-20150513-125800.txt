Okay, so here is the link for section 01. https://librivox.org/uploads/availle/stoneaxeburkamukk_01_bruce128kb.mp3The duration of the recording is 26:25. I enjoyed the approach I took in this recording. I will confess that my representation of the Australian Aboriginal people sounded slightly like a Native American narrative, but in the end I think it added some character to the overall tone of the story as an ancient legend. I also couldn't help but notice a big parallel between this story and other legendary epics like Beowulf. And that's interesting considering that both stories were told on completely different continents by different cultures. Odd they are, the ties that bind.
