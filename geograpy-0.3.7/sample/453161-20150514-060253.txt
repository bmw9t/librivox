And I will volunteer to read Section 3 - Mind and brain, as it is about time I learned how they work. 

EDIT: And should we read the section number in the intro, instead of the Chapter number, as some of the chapters have now been split into more than one section?

i.e. Section 3 of Psychotherapy etc... then the disclaimer... then Chapter 3 Mind and Brain.
