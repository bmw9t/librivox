Greetings,Alphiloscorp here, doing my introduction on the forums.Real Life Stuff that might be fun to know:I am 23 years old and a junior by credit attending The University of Texas at Dallas.I am majoring in cognitive science and plan to double degree in computer engineering.I am native to Texas and am mostly a Heinz 57 Caucasian.The biggest of which is Scottish (25%), but I am a regrettable single generation too far removed from my Choctaw blood to qualify as native American or a member of the tribe.It makes for an interesting phenotype: mostly hairless, very pale, and mostly Anglo looking... Except for my high cheekbones and ability to tan from pasty->brown at an alarming rate. Ginger, I am not.Why I am here:I love knowledge. I love books. I love hearing books read to me and reading them to others. To me it is a great privelage and opportunity for excellence to be able to present knowledge to another person with the sound of your own voice.My forum name is derive thusly: Alpha-Philosopher-Scorpio. The three easiest rules of thumb for understanding who I am and what angle I come from. I don't believe in astrology to a religious extent, but I find when it is interpreted consistently it makes for nice Mental shorthand.I look forward to getting involved in group and solo projects and getting to know the memenrs here.Thanks,Alphiloscorp
