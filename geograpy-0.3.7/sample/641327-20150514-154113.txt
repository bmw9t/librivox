I'd be happy to do sections 18, 19, and 20.

Note, however, that Section 19 (Chapter 13) has two (short) passages in French -- letters to M. Heger. Shall we do those like the earlier chapters, with Ruth voicing the French? If pushed, I could read the French myself, but I'd be sweating;  I thought the arrangement for the earlier chapters worked well.
