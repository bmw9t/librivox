Hi,
   I'm finished with my Chapter 6, I'll do Chapter 7, as well. Here's my link from YouSendIt for my Chapter 6...

I enjoyed reading this alot!  My total time for chapter 6 was 15:58. I finally figured out how to add my name to the Wiki page. So, I think I'm set there. I think I caught all my errors, but after listening to it for 3 or 4 times, I quit being able to hear any.  I'm hoping you catch any I missed, and that there aren't any glaring ones.

P.S. I am eager for any suggestions for improvement in my reading. This is my second ever recording. I'm also eager for help to get the best quality recording possible, to cut down on the book coordinator's job. I used Audacity to do my initial recording, and first edits, then pulled it into Goldwave for more fine tuning. I'm not real adept at Goldwave, so would welcome help with it. I've not used in such a long time, I need to re-learn how to equalize volume, ect.
