The First Violin by Jessie Fothergill (1851-1891).This project is now complete! All audio files can be found on our catalog page: http://librivox.org/the-first-violin-by-jessie-fothergill/ Quote:May Wedderburn is a quiet provincial girl, living in small and seemingly boring Skernford. Underneath the dull exterior, there is mystery, suspicion and fear in this little town, surrounding the austere local wealthy landowner who is very interested in marrying poor May. It looks as though she will have to marry him whether she likes it or not until an unsuspected alliance is formed between her and a respected old lady. They both escape to Germany where music and excitement await them.
