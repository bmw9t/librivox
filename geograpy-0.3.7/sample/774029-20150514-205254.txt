That was fun!

Let me know if these are alright and I'll know its safe to try other projects on this site.

I did have one issue with the ID tags:  You indicated the mp3 file should be named with one nomenclature while the title in the ID tag should be something else.  When I change the file name, the title in the ID tag changes to match.  When I change the title in the ID tag, the file name changes to reflect this.  I'm using Itunes to set up the tags.

I hope this isn't a major issue.

Anyway, I left it as the ID tag title indicated.
