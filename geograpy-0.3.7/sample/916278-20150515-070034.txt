Most were truly awful.I saw 'Scanner Darkly' not so long ago and thought they'd managed to capture some of the flavour of the book really quite well.Yes! I just heard that from someone else who's a PKD fan. Haven't seen it myself yet, but look forward to it.
We watched it recently.  I hadn't read the book; Dan had.  We both thought it was well done.

Great Movie Adaptations:
Wives and Daughters  (1999, Justine Waddell)
Cold Comfort Farm (Kate Beckinsale)
P&P (Firth/Ehle. Duh.)
Emma (Kate Beckinsale)
Persuasion (Amanda Root)
Northanger Abbey (2007, Felicity Jones)
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (Depp -- I HATE the Wilder version)
North & South (2004, Daniela Denby-Ashe. Haven't read the book, but the miniseries *felt* right)

I thought the LotT trilogy was very good, if somewhat ponderous. Ditto LW&W.  Looking forward to Caspian!
