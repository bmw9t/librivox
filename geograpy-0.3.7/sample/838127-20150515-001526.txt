I think there is a lot in this. 

Air traffic controllers are not allowed (or so I understand) to work for more than 40 mins at a stretch without taking a break. You cannot work at maximum intensity for more than this. The problem is that many people don't have the insight to realise their performance is dropping off.

This is certainly the case with practising or performing on musical instruments. Two half hour practise sessions a day allow you to progress much faster than a one hour session. 

I suspect that reading aloud requires similar concentration. Perhaps reading has the same problems as scale practice - if you continue to push on after the time when you should have taken a break you start to make mistakes, and your brain starts to learn gto repeat the mistakes instead of doing things the right way.
