There is absolutely no need to apologise, Shelagh! On the contrary - it is VERY kind and patient of you to go along the text while listening and I appreciate your punctuality very much indeed! I suppose the "damage" to the quality is immaterial, while "feel free to ignore" Dickens I cannot! So, please, go on in the same spirit! If you notice a failure in the enunciation, you may freely point it out as well, so long as it does not burden you too much. This, again, will be truly appreciated.
