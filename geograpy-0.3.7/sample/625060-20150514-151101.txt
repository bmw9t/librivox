Loved the story, tho' I had to listen twice to get the ending! 

Questions about the author and the title: 

1) is it "All the World a Grave" or "All the Earth a Grave"? You say Earth all three times you say the title (twice at beginning and once at end), which doesn't match the title here.

2) what name for the author? You give just CC McCapps at the beginning, but add the AKA at the end. (Gregg, want to weigh in?)

You started a sentence over twice in this recording, should probably edit:

06:30 "The advertising manager who had put the thing...."

13:10 "It isn't hard to imagine the reactions...."

Thanks, I'll be happy to relisten when it's ready!
