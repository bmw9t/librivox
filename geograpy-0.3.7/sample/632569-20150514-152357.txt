Christian,

I take my hat off to you! (Where did you study?  Where have you lived, to perfect your accent like that?).  I've not listened all the way through yet, but I was totally convinced from the first few words.  Excellent.

If you have the interest and the stamina, please do claim more stories.


Everyone - 

I've taken the surgeon's axe to the project, removing the Cantonese sections completely.  We only had one Cantonese recording submitted, and I'll put that into the Multilingual Stories collection.  The claims for the Cantonese sections have been deleted (they were very old indeed).  I've also removed genecode as DPL.   Although she was the driving force behind the project, she's clearly no longer around.  Thankfully we have her Mandarin recording.

This means that we're now not too far away from completing the project.  I'd entreat those who have recorded, or could record, in Mandarin to give this a final push.  It would be a shame to see it languish.

Jc - If you can PM me the sftp login, I'll amend the filenames to align them with the new section numbers.


Many thanks all!

David
