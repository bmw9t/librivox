Would it make any improvement for someone, say, myself, to email them to inquire about the copyright status of those recordings?We thought long and hard about this collection, because copyright is always so complicated with both words and music, and accompaniments were just going to make it even more complicated. So we decided in the end:The first post wrote:Guidelines on how to record a hymn• This is a sung collection. The words and the tune of all hymns must be in the public domain (that is, not copyrighted). See this page for more info on copyrights. You can always ask in this thread if you're not sure whether a hymn is public domain.• If there is a musical accompaniment, this must be performed by you alone, using the Public Domain music source. 

So I think we'd better stick with that.
