Hello Robert, welcome to this project.I've listened to your recording.Normally new readers make a test recording first (see: http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/Newbie_Guide_to_Recording)You didn't, so I take this recording as your test.It's almost good. The only problem that you have is, that you have a lot of background noise. In your file It's easy to remove that digitally. See: http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/Noisecleaning_With_PicsCould you please take a look at that page and reupload the noise cleaned file?Thanks!Bart
