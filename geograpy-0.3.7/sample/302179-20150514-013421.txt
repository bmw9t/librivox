I've been out the last week due to a cold, so I apologize for the delay!Yes Mrs b, with your wonderful reading voice I think you should take the time to clear up the technical problems so that future recordings will be better.  Upon listening to Chapter 15, my opinion is that you should re record it again.  I think you would be much happier doing so.For example, in 15 there was significant up and down of volume in the first 6 minutes, loud then soft, loud then soft.  7:28 was a stumble 'clos  closest';  8:52 microphone scratching;  10:02 some scratching noises;  10:11 microphone bump or rumble; 10:20 to 10:23 garbled sound overlaid your voice;10:40 to 10:47 more microphone rumble16:24 to 16:27 mic rumble or something. There were parts that were significantly better than others so whatever you did in them, keep it up!        So, please be patient with yourself and with Librivox.  Like I said, your reading style is enjoyable and just some technical stuff is keeping your recordings from being delightful. Perhaps you could upload a test of a raw minute or so, without fixing in any way so we could suggest some solutions.   Thanks!
