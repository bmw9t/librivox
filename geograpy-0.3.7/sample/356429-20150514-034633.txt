You actually got me laughing at a few points.  Some (very minor) corrections:1:10 - "But this lady from whom you propose to die has no virtue." (should be for whom)2:28 - "Anyway, people who do things don't make such fuss about them." (should be "so much fuss" -- although this might be minor enough to overlook)3:12 - "You see, honor camouflage so many things" (should be "camouflages")5:40 - Are you a stenographer? --the word "stenographer," which I always seem to get wrong myself, is mispronounced (sten-ah-graph-er) or rather, click here6:06 - Tell us: are you the woman Gordon Wallace was with on the night October 25 (should be "the night of October 25")Thanks again.  This is a splendid, super-funny performance.  I can't wait to start editing this thing.Oh, thanks! I had a lot of fun doing it:DThe fixed version is uploaded:)
