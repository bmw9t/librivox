You are making a knowledge claim about the nature of knowledge, that it is all subjective.  But that position undermines itself.  It is like saying, "There are no such thing as facts."  It omits the implied words, "It is a fact that," which would make the statement, "It is a fact that there are no such thing as facts," and which hides its self-contradictory nature.    What if I said  "It is my opinion that there are no such things as facts." ?
