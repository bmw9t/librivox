He wears me out and chapter 3 has Italian    in it. (Which Karen kindly recorded for me months ago and I started working on it but it didn't go very well and sort of got put on the back burner.) Also, just getting over my cold, I'm not in the best voice and I need to be to read those.  But I will get back to it I promise. And soon, though I may finish this one up first.  (But I'll try to get to that before starting the other poetry book.  Hopefully.   )
