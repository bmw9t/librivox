Hallo Seepferdchen Hanna - huebsche Namen  Built-in microphones are notoriously bad, as they pick up too much background noise... There are nice microphones for about 20 - 30 EUR out there - get a USB one (flat plug) - they tend to be the best value for money at your early stage...  And welcome too, by the way!
