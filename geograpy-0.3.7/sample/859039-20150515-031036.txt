Here are a few of my favorites:

Ethan Frome, by Edith Wharton- read by Elizabeth Klett

The Age of Innocence by Edith Wharton - read by Brenda Dayne

The Card by Arnold Bennett read by Andy Minter

Some Experiences of an Irish R.M. by Edith Oenone Somerville and Martine Ross - read by Andy Minter

The Scarlet Pimpernel by Baroness Orzcy- read by Karen Savage

Tarzan of the Apes by Edgar Rice Burroughs - read by Mark F. Smith

Uncle Tom's Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe - read by John Greenman

I'm sure I'll have more to add soon - I'm ready to listen to Karen Savage's version of Persuasion, and then some of the "Jeeves" Wodehouse books.
