Here is my 1 minute test:  https://librivox.org/uploads/tests/test_carmelea.mp3For the catalog credit, you can use my name: Carmen Fullmer Thank you, CarmenThanks Carmen.  Well, your voice is wonderful and most tech stuff is OK but there are a few things I'd like you to fix and upload another test:1) your recording is in stereo, it needs to be in mono (one track)(see my video on how to do this simply)2) your recording volume is too low at 77 dB.  we like it to be nearer 89 dB.  It is much better to increase the volume going into Audacity rather than rely on amplfying the track so if there is a gain knob on your mic or somewhere, use that.  If this is confusing I do have some videos for both things just let me know or follow the link in my signature. they are somewhere in there.  here is the one on volume. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9WF82rf81o So please fix those two little things, upload another test in this thread and you will be recording in a jiffy!!!!!
