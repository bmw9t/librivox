Welcome to LibriVox Pete!   We're always glad to see new volunteers and we do hope you have lots of fun around here.   As Carol mentioned, before you start recording, we ask that you send in a 1-minute test recording. This is not an audition, it's just to make sure the sound quality and the recording settings are all right - often things can be improved at the outset that are difficult to fix later. Please go to this wiki page to find out what to record for your 1-minute test, and how to upload the recording.If you don't want to record, you can proof listen (PL)! Proof-listening is the process of listening to a recording in order to catch recording mistakes, and verify that the file meets the technical requirements. All recordings are "prooflistened" to catch repeats, big stumbles or long pauses.  Please visit the Guide For Proof Listeners for more information.   Please ask if you have any questions.  Happy LibriVoxing!
