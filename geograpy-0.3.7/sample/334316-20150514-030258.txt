Just a couple of notes:1) 10:36 (chap 19 - pg. 353) "After this, returning into Britain,916 he converted the province of the South Saxons from their idolatrous worship to the faith of Christ", you read "of the faith of Christ"2: 11:21 (chap 19 - pg. 354) you skipped a paragraph starting with "His acquittal was much forwarded by the reading of the acts of the synod of Pope Agatho,924 of blessed memory, which had been formerly held, when Wilfrid was in Rome and sat in council among the bishops, as has been said before." and ending with  "This being heard, the Pope and all the rest said, that a man of so great authority, who had held the office of a bishop for nearly forty years, ought by no means to be condemned, but being altogether cleared of the faults laid to his charge, should return home with honour."Oops again, good that there is a prooflistening step in this. Sorry for the mess-ups. The corrected file now uploaded athttp://upload.librivox.org/share/uploads/tg/ecclesiasticalhistoryofengland_27_bede.mp3New section length is now 20:10.Hope this does the trick now.So long!Ernst
