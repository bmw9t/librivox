Hi Rapunzelina, and Masa,I re-recorded my 1 min test, using a new mic, and did NOT apply any noise cancelling. https://librivox.org/uploads/tests/test_minnetonkamark_new.mp3I dug out my Logitech Pro 9000 web cam. It actually has a "â€¢Premium built-in microphone with RightSound Technology for crystal-clear conversations"  Here is a link to one at Amazon:http://tinyurl.com/n2skdkzI hung it from my monitor in the normal way, and spoke in a conversational voice. I was really happy with the results. You should notice that my background sound has disappeared. btw Rapunzelina, I tried your suggestion and used the noise cancelling filter in Audacity. It took 2 times, but worked perfectly! Thank you! (again, my new test file has no filtering)Looking forward to hear any suggestions, or problems that need attention.Thank You,Mark PalmerMinnetonkaMark
