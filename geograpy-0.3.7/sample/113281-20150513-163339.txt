I see that the MW still shows it as "assigned"--I'm slow with some of my sections, but I'm really not being delinquent on that one! Hey again, Joe--I think that you might have missed my post?  Aazuline posted after I did, and it popped onto a new page...so thought I'd better try again.Thanks!WHOOPS sorry Lucretia, I don't know how I missed you there.  I am just happy this book is getting back on the radar.  Sections 9 and 10 are YOURS!!
