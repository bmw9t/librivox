(I have studied up!)  ... I hadn't listened to any of your previous recordings, and, not listening to it from a critiquing standpoint, but just cuz I wanted to hear the chapter, I thought you did just fine! I enjoyed listening to it, which is all that really matters. It's a really good chapter, too! I'm sure whatever editing goes into it, will only add to the delight of the listener. Keep up the good work
