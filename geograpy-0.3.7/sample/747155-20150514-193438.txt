Chris,

I think that would be fine in this instance, since the gutenberg e-text  reads thus:

Man cannot KNOW in
any higher sense than this, any more than he can look serenely
and with impunity in the face of the sun: "You will not perceive
that, as perceiving a particular thing," say the Chaldean
Oracles.

and

We have to be told that the
Greeks called the world Beauty, or Order, but we do not see
clearly why they did so, and we esteem it at best only a curious
philological fact.
