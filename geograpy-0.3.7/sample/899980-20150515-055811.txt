I get that a lot.  Actually, oddly enough, it wasn't. See, that would have made sense, and my dreams never make sense.  I think it was actually ceastman -- whoever it was I was arguing with was insisting that it was "C Eastman," while I was pronouncing it "seestman."

So that's me...  And you've got it right both ways, actually.

It's short for Catharine Eastman - C Eastman.  

BUT, when *I* look at it and pronounce it in my head, it's all one word - "seestman," as you put it.  

So, no need to argue.
