Hey everyone, im using Audacity and im after making a stupid mistake, i havent left the mandatory amount of time at the end and ive no idea how to stretch the recording. I had a quick look in the editing guide but didnt see anything. 

There must be an easy fix so i thought i would just throw the question on here so any ideas would be great.

Thanks.
