If you're fond of the Hurst story, I suggest that you read it at a comfortable pace and post it as a solo work on the Launch Pad (once you've acquired an MC).  I've soloed on three long short stories myself.

For this collection here, I want to keep things under 80 minutes as much as possible.  I read a Hurst story that came out at a little over an hour in recording time, for instance.
