Hi Elizabby, I do personally know all the readers who have old claims on the characters. I have either spoken with them/or emailed them recently to let them know we're trying to finish this book by May. They have asked for a few more weeks, and I forgot to update the dates. Sorry about that!Hey, thank you for showing an interest in this project. I will definitely let you know if any part is opened up!!!
