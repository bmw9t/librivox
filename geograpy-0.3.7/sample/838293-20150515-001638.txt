Hi Planish - I simply copy and paste the files, or select and move them, and I've tried doing this in blocks, or one at a time - makes no difference. I've also fiddled with the ID3's - no difference. They seem always to play in the same [wrong] order- I've been through all the other settings [ie 'random play' etc] without success  One thing I have noticed though, is that if I load no more than five at a time, it works ok - misterioso ! hefyd
