Hello, I am King Wilhelm-Rudolf of the Kingdom of Ruritania. Those of you who have Anthony Hope will know of my country. Today we are a micronation that can be found at http://www.ruritania.net. In truth you can call me Bill. I am a 100% disabled USAF veteran. I love to read. I am starting for LibriVox with the 1771 Encyclopedia Britianica. It is a long project but I have no pressing issues of state since my chancellors are very adept. I am planning on beginning my reading this weekend. So far everyone I have been in contact with has been really great. I take this site very seriously. What I cannot find is how to links to put on my website advertizing LibriVox.

Have a simply marvelous day.
