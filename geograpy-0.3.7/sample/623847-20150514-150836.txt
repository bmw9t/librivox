Ben,

Looks like you've mastered the magic window.  I've posted in Listeners Wanted for you, but if we get a dedicated prooflistener, I can delete that thread and you can do all the posting in this one.  

Also as I think I mentioned in an earlier post, since this is not technically a "solo," I am going to move this thread to Readers Found where we work on group projects that are fully subscribed.  I'll wait until you have seen this post though so you don't wonder where the thread went next time you come looking for it.  

Jo
