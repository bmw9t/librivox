Laurie Anne (Chocoholic on the forums) pointed that fact out to me and I didn't even realize there was a Bear Creek in NC. Although I understand you can great fruit cake there. I personally cringe at the thought of eating fruit cake. 

I live in a rural area that doesn't really have a name, but there's a tiny, tiny community (blink your eye and you've missed it) that is called Bear Creek, so it's not even on the map.   It's evidently a popular name for places.
