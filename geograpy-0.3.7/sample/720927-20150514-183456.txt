Can I change a line in my chapter?  I'm recording it now, and I've written "A nuclear weapon had been detonated within visible range", and I"ve tried, but I can't say it without it sounding like 

"with invisible range" to the listener.  

Could I just change that to somethng like "exploded only eight miles away"?
