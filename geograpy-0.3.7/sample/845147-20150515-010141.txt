Praise for CliveCatterall (Clive Catterall) via the 'Thank a reader' feature:Quote:Mr. Catterall:I greatly enjoyed listening to your reading of The White Company by Arthur Conan Doyle. You have a tremendous gift of portraying the characters by the voice you give to each.  Your consistent voice for each character brought each one to life and made them like old friends as the story progressed.  Thank you for your thoughtful portrayal and reading.  Please continue to bring these wonderful stories to us listeners.Russell C.http://librivox.org/the-white-company-by-sir-arthur-conan-doyle/--------Ruth
