MaryAnn, I was a little bewildered to see that this note has appeared at the head of this post:   "Volunteers outside the USA: May Sinclair died in 1946. Her work is still protected by copyright in places, like Europe, where copyright is author's death plus 70 years, Australia (author's death plus 70 years for authors who died after 1954) or Canada (author's death plus 50 years)."My friend Arithmetic tells me that Europe is the only region of the three where it would be an issue....I've done a lot of Sinclair and have never seen this note before.  Does it affect me in any way?
