The Calendar and Other Verses by Irving Sydney Dix ( - ).

(Summary by Woolly Bee)This project is now complete! All audio files can be found on our catalog page: https://librivox.org/the-calendar-and-other-verses-by-irving-sydney-dix/How to claim a part, and "how it all works" here To find a section to record, simply look at point 5. below at the sections. All the ones without names beside them are "up for grabs." Click "Post reply" at the top left of the screen and tell us which section you would like to read (include the section number from the left-most column in the reader list, please). Read points 6. to 8. below for what to do before, during and after your recording. New to recording? Please read our Newbie Guide to Recording! Is there a deadline? We ask that you submit your recorded sections within 1 month of placing your claim. Please note that to be fair to the readers who have completed their sections in a timely way, if you haven't submitted your recording(s) after one month, your sections will automatically be re-opened for other readers to claim, unless you post in this thread to request an extension. Extensions will be granted at the discretion of the Book Coordinator.  If you cannot do your section, for whatever reason, just let me know and it'll go back to the pool. There's no shame in this; we're all volunteers and things happen. Please do not sign up for more sections than you can complete within the one month deadline. Where do I find the text?
