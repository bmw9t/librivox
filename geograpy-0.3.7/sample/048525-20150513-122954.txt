Hi Ellis, 

I hope it won't be in two years time. 
But as the list of books I'd like to record is getting bigger and bigger and my time, to the contrary, tighter and tighter, you might very well be fluent in French by the time I get started  (not sure you'd need to be to prooflisten though).  

I'll let you know anyway. 

See you around!
