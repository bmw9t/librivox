Here is Section 34 - "Rachel and Her Uncle."http://upload.librivox.org/share/uploads/tg/thomaswingfoldcurate_34_macdonald.mp3I'm a little unhappy with how much my letter "s" seems to whistle. When you PL, please indicate if this is an acceptable amount or if there are things I can do (either during recording or post-production) which will minimize this whistle. I am content to re-record if necessary.If this is PL OK, then I would like to volunteer to read Section 35 as well.
