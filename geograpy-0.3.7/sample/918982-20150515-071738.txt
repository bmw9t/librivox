i bet there are more interesting people than you think in wisconsin willing to talk about the environment...but yes, it requires more than reading an existing text.

as for panache, i say that's mostly overrated (tho nice). the important thing is the information - which is often much easier to absorb in audio than text. if you did one 5 minute interview per month on important issues (say: climate change, additives in milk, farming & water quality, industrial energy efficiency, pesticides on food, wetlands conservation, wildlife conservation, vegetarianism, smog, transportation, factory farming, industrial waste), you'd only have to find 12 interesting people to talk to!
