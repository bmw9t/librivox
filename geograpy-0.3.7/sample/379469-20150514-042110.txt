thanks rapunzelina. ill send a pm to remind the readers of sections with edits needed of those edits.for the future, please note that it is rather inconvenient to submit claims and sections via pm. that is exactly what the thread is there for, and also, it is difficult to document these submissions when they are via pm -- especially when the pm goes to the dpl instead of the bc by accident. pms are deleted when the inbox is too full while posts in a thread are here for eternity CKeta: reminder sent!
