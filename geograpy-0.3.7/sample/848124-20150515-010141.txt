Praise for GordMackenzie (Gord Mackenzie) via the 'Thank a reader' feature:Quote:Hi Gordon, Really appreciate your reading of Walden by Henry David Thoreau. I’m listening for the third time at present. This is the only book I’ve listened to so far from LibriVox but I expect there’ll be more. Always loved Thoreau and what he stood for and his interest in Eastern wisdom, along with Emerson and other transcendentalists of the time. All the best to you and thank-you, RodWoodendVictoriaAustraliaWaldenAll of Gord's recordings
