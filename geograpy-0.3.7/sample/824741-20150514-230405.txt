I have some old books at home and I have also a library card for both Prague Municipal and National Library so I am able to scan book info and other parts and send it to anyone in charge. I would, however, rather not scan the whole texts... or is it possible to cooperate even with Guttenberg itself and scan the book for them so there would be both text and audio version prepared? (though I'd prefer not to proof-read myself, I'm staring on PC all the day long and speaking aloud is quite a good change while proof-reading really isn't). I should be probably asking in some more apropriate thread but it's already here--I'll copy it somewhere else if noone will answer here  There was some effort to bring Czech poetry of 19th and 20th century to the reader and so the Institute for Czech language and literature of the Czech Academy of Sciences created a database of full-texts of mainly the poetry books from this era. The list of them could be find here and there are also years of the first publishing. If it is ok, we can start with the these texts and choose those published before 1924 (US law) by the authors who died before 1941 (Czech law). It would be easier for me to do short poems than long prose, anyway--at least in the beginning.Public Domain questions bring my cranium close to the explosion point very rapidly, so I try to avoid them and stick to more technical stuff.  I'll direct her here for some guidance.  Thanks!Dennis
