Please could I have a ruling on the correct position in Part 15 of the list of the seven wise men: the Penguin translation (by Scott-Kilvert) places it as a footnote at the end of Section 3, where it seems to make rather more sense of what follows than it does in the position in which it appears in the link to the text.
