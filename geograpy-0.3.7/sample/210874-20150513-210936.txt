I noticed the unusual pronunciation of Alaric initially, but I attributed it to the difference between British English and American English and thought nothing further of it. I figure that you can pronounce it however you want. I really didn't notice the few instances where you stressed the first syllable. I'd just leave it as, and be consistent going forward. That's what I did in one of my projects with a similar issue.I have time to re-listen to CH 3 should you choose to redo the voice, but I think the readers will just adjust to the new voice in a new chapter. I have a bad cold and can't record right now, so I have time.
