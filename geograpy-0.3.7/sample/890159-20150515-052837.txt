This would make a fun warm-up!I always have to laugh when, in sixth grade, our class was supposed to take turns reading out loud paragraphs from a non-fiction story about the coral reef.  Thankfully, I was spared the embarrassment of pronouncing what I thought was a Polly-pee.[That's polyp.]    My teacher would have had a riot!
