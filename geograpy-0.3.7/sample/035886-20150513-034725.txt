Hi, I'm Jan, Chrisczech's missus. I've heard Chris recording and seen the enjoyment he gets from giving. Also, I've been a listener to many of your recordings. I LOVE reading and being read to. I think it is time I gave a little something back. I do not know just at this moment what I can do, but I think in steps, and joining the forum seems to be a move in the right direction. No longer "sitting on the fence".
There now Jan, that wasn't too difficult, was it?
