I'm guessing this is just what it sounds like but I have never seen one, etc. Because of this I don't know what status "2" means.Also, does this mean there will be nowhere in your catalog to note if there is a only a link FROM wikipedia?  If this is the case there would be no need to report here in LibriVox that there is a link from wiki to librivox right? I'm updating wikipedia pages now and wondering if I should post the results here. What do you think?
