Hey!My name is Lucas and I'm a college senior who is majoring in English and minoring in Speech Communications. I'm in the secondary education program at Concordia University in Ann Arbor Michigan. I plan to get a masters in Theater because it's what I really love. I can't wait to get my hand on a good piece for me to read but in the mean time I'll probably go for some shorter pieces to get used to the process. Also it would be a good idea to not take on a big project so that I can do well in school. Hope you are all doing well and I can't wait to be apart of this community!~LucasENGMajor
