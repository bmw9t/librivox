Stephen, Thanks for the file, and I've signed you up for the next one.

skern922, Perhaps you are referring to Anita's ftp server (studioae.com)? I don't have one available. If you have questions about that, you can send a PM (Private Message); her forum name is a.r.dobbs. There are also some additional methods listed on this page: http://librivox.org/wiki/moin.cgi/HowTo ... rRecording

Jeff, thanks for your file and I'll update your name in the database =)
