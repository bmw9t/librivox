With the proviso that we can't always expect to achieve perfection:Most of those noises sound mechanical to me, Phil, rather than er... personal .  They sound in some cases almost like keyboard strokes. I would try not to cause those in the first place, whereas the mouthy sounds are not necessarily avoidable.  The danger with both methods is that you may de-amplify or paste over more than you intend: e.g. the 'c' of 'public' as well as the click. I'd suggest using the visual as well as the audible clues: I always edit in View | Fit Vertically. You can see much more.-18 dB doesn't always get rid of the noise. I have Amplify set at -10 dB and press Ctrl+R until I reach the desired effect - often x2 or x3, but sometimes just once. There is always the Undo button, if it has gone too far. In the first example, pasting over ambient noise is preferable to my ear, as the distinct 'k' sound in 'public' wasn't vital anyway.'I have received': in this case, it sounds to me as if the click (whatever it was) actually covered up the 'd' of received. I would re-record, or paste in a light 'd'.The noise after 'membrane' is still audible after deamplifying by 18 dB. I don't think you caught quite all of the noise with the copy/paste.Ruth
