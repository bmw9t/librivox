Colleagues: I just recorded Section 28 (Chapter 18) but then noticed that I didn't put in the translator in the intro and closing.

I've got to run along to work now, but later this evening, I'll clean up those bits and post the file.

Sorry that end-of-semester demands have kept me from posting sooner!
