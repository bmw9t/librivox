It is 30 years today since mt. st. Helen's blew her top.  When it blew I lived in Nelson BC.  We heard the explosion, and were inundated with ash.  I was in high school, and our school was closed for two day as half our teachers were stuck in Spokane, having gone down for the fun run.  The pictures that came out of the blast zone were surreal!
