I am a practicing attorney and recovering sound editor/designer for motion pictures.  I've worked on a number of movies you've probably seen.  If you're interested you can find them at imdb.com[.]  Just enter Jonascu, I'm the only one by that name.  Anyway, I've been a huge spoken-word fan most of my adult life.  I love old time radio, particularly Jack Benny, and Vic and Sade, if those names ring a bell any more. I love Librivox, and am just hammy enough to want to read.  Being a big Mark Twain fan, I'm pleased to find there are still some of his works that haven't been recorded yet. I have a question for some of the more established Librivox users.  Has anyone recorded any stories with original music, sound effects, or both?  These wouldn't be dramatizations, just strict readings enhanced with additional atmospherics   If I wanted to do so, is there a forum for that material on Librivox?  I'd be happy to draft any additional waivers/releases required.Either way, I'd like to thank the administrators and readers for adding so much pleasure and education to my life.  This really is the best corner of the internet, and I look forward to being a contributor.Best, Michael
