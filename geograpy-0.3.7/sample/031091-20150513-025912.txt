Yes! Julila has already joined our Dutch-language collaborative project, so that's international now too!! I look forward to hearing her in Dutch/Flemish. 
Oh - and Julie, you might contribute a Flemish poem to the Multilingual poetry project, if you like. I don't think we have anything in Flemish yet.
