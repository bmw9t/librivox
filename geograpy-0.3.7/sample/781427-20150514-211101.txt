David,

As this is a "book" project, should I be introducing every individually recorded poem with a mention of the poem title AND the title of the book?

Something like "The River Merchant's Wife: A Letter," from Cathay by Ezra Pound, recorded for LibriVox dot org by Guss Klumpp."

Also, the LV theme music clip only goes at the beginning of the very first poem or chapter in the series, correct?

Thnx,

Guss
