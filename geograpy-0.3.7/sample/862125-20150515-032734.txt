You mean that I am still allowed to say something that is not a praise? 
Well, than I'll put it this way. I am sure I do not speak only for myself when I say that for those who want to listen to a good book in good English (and I daresay that is correct for other languages too) the mistakes that non-native readers make almost ruin the whole idea! I do not mean accents!  If a German, a Frenchman, a Russian etc. does khow English really well - than to listen to their work is really a pleasure. I've seen in other branches of this forum that people take trouble to ask how to pronounce some words - I take my hat off to them! They do try to read correctly! And I would be glad to listen to their work. 

BUT! You will admit that in some cases it is not so. Someone (naming no names) thinks that his English is good - and he volunteers to read. And, as this project is interested in enlarging the quantity of recorded books - his or her help is accepted. And the result is that some part of the book is recorded... well, not ot give offence, let's say "not too well". 

You may say - skip that part and go on listening to other ones. Or find another book. Or look for an audiobook recorded by professionals and enjoy it.  But is this the goal of this project??? 

What exactly is the goal? To have as many books recorded as posssibe?  To give readers a possibility to do the reading? 

You record books in many languages. Than maybe it is wiser not to spoil good books by not very good reading, but to ask those who have not yet learned one language well enouph to do the reading in their native language??? For the benefit of both the listeners and the readers.
