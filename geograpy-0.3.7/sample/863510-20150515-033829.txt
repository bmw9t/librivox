I understand the reasoning perfectly, but am probably not going to resist the temptation in certain of my own future projects.    I'm not sure I agree that they're not marketing, though -- they get a wide redistribution  in a lot of places, and I think marketing is exactly what they are - explaining to potential listeners why to pick that book to hear next.

"After" it is.  I love $50 words, and worked for a while in a legal office - a deadly combo.  "come-on" is not defined!  (deliberately) although if really extreme, they might be a problem.  Some restraint may be necessary, but . . . .  I'm going to soften it.
