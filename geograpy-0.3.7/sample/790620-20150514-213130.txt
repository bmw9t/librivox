Suitable?  It's wonderful, Henry!  Thanks so much for submitting it!  It's great to have folks of ALL ages reading these Fables, because each one of us brings something special to the reading and makes it unique - just as you have done.

I hope to hear your voice on many more LibriVox projects in the future!  Oh, and please let me know how you would like to be credited on the Catalog page - we can add a URL if you like.

And with that, Volume 5 is complete!  I'll rustle up a checksheet so that everyone can listen and check their info - but at the moment I'm going to bed!

Funny how Vol 5 is complete, but Vols 3&4 are still hanging out there...  I like this new system!
