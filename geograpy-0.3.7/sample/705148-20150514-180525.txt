Goodness, I thought I answered that ages ago!  I see.  The tentative deadline for the time being is December 4th (the end of the November event) since I have most of the files in, but there definitely may have to be some slack-cutting in that direction, so let me know if things get hectic for you and you have to delay.

The project is set up like a standard dramatic work -- record your lines with a five-second pause between lines (that's lines of speech, not lines of text, of course) for ease of editing.  Save them as an uncompressed file -- either a .wav or .aiff -- and send them along here or stick them in the uploader and post a link.

The only thing I would ask is that you also consider reading Falstaff for the second half of Henry IV as well.   Thanks!
