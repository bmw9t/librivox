Checker told me that your file passed as well, but I listened with headphones and heard the "oooo" background noise - its loud enough that it would really annoy me if I tried to listen to you read a whole chapter with that in the background.  That's why I'm suggesting a bit of cleaning on your file.Noise cleaning is subjective - it's not loud enough for Checker to pick it up as a problem (maybe because it's at a couple of isolated frequencies), but yet when you listen, it's clearly there in the background.Are you recording with Audacity or GarageBand?  Because if you can't shut off whatever is causing the sound to start with, removing it will be more difficult with GB . . .MaryAnn
