Thanks so much, Jacquerie! Btw, I really like your voice! It's very pleasant! (And I don't flatter; I'm also somewhat picky about voices as I have a strange aural thing--I'm sensitive to voices, for some reason.) 

All your technical things are correct (ID3 tags, etc.) & thanks for changing translator's name (that was confusing, I know), but I'm still not sure if it's loud enough. I downloaded it to my ipod & am listening to it now, but I had to turn my ipod volume all the way up. However, I am also quite new to recording, so I'm still learning myself. And the headphones I use for my ipod are a bit unique & also have a volume control. Sooo . . . (after having talked so much!! LOL   )

Why don't we wait & see what someone experienced like Sarah, our MC, or Karen, our PL'er, says about your recording level? I've put your new file in the Magic Window. Thanks so much! I'm so glad you're recording for our book!
