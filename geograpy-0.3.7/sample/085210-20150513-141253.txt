Volume testing and adjustment is easy Paul.You need to download MP3Gain from here: http://mp3gain.sourceforge.net/download.phpAnd watch Phil's video on using MP3Gain here:  https://sites.google.com/site/librivideo/for-volunteers/processes#2Be sure to do all volume adjustments in Audacity, not with MP3Gain.  Your recordings have quite a few very narrow spikes.  That may make it difficult to simply adjust the volume up with Effects/Amplify.  So for your wave pattern, it may help to use Effects/Leveler as a first step.  That will bring up the quiet bits and bring down the spikes.  From there, you can make further adjustments using Effects/Amplify.MaryAnn
