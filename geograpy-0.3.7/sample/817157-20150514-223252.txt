Now I am ready to go, nothing can stop me now (until the next unsuspected snag that is).I must say how wonderful it is when we encounter a problem how many nice people offer help and assistance, I'm beginning to feel at home in Librivox.Best wishes all my my helpers,JohnYou are very welcome.  Your hard earned knowledge and skill with editing will serve you well for your first 1000 sections.  Also you will be part of the 'helper' crowd soon, Iknow it. I see that in making some of those editing videos, I assumed that people had the same settings as I did.  Do you think a video called "setting up Audacity before you record", would be useful?.  You know, stuff like that pesky overdub box and other stuff.
