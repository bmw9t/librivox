No new chapter today, but instead: we finally managed to get out! Everything got very late so in the end it was after 5pm and we had to be back before the dark because the lights on the car we currently have (of friends) are unreliable - or at least we can't work them reliably. So only a short sundowner sail up the coast and back. Flat sea, light winds, warm enough just in a t-shirt - and we so smoked a monohull that was way in front of us. It was a little gusty, and with every gust of breeze our light boat just surges forward, whereas their's looked like it sat still in the water... not that I'm competitive or anything. But it's always nice to have something to measure one's speed against (our speedo wasn't working). 

It was so very lovely lovely lovely I can't tell you. I'm thinking of taking the laptop on board and doing a recording there - would be quite fitting for the Riddle, don't you think?
