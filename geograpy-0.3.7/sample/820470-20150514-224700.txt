I don't know at all where to start, Tim, but perhaps I could recommend a friend who does?  Howard Rheingold's just published Net Smart and is putting together courses on Online Cooperation and Network Literacy ... (his recently posted mindmap for this latter is pretty cool.) It's just one strand but might be relevant?
