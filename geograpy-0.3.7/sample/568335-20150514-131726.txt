Inakachick, Sorry, I think this post was lost in the Christmas season 

I did listen to your test now, and the levels and settings are perfect, even the volume is fine (I think), although that is usually an issue for beginners.
The only little thing is you have a lot of plosives, you might wanna play a bit with your mic, that is try different positions a bit farther away from your mouth to avoid this, but that should be easy.


To everybody:
Happy New Year 
Thanks dii and rd, I'm back for good!
