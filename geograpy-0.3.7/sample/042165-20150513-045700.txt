I've started a Solo project reading The Celebrity by Churchill. It's his first book (sort of....Richard Carvel was being written already......but The Celebrity was published first.....if I understood right).... some reviewers thought it was a satire of writer Richard Harding Davis, which Churchill denied.aloha,joe t.It's over here right now.
