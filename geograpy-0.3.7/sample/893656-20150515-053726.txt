"I don't much care where--" said Alice. "Then it doesn't much matter which way you go," said the Cat. "--so long as I get somewhere," Alice added as an explanation."Oh, you're sure to do that," said the Cat, "if you only walk long enough."Ain't that the truth, Chesh?  This is my favorite section in the entire book!  I'm so glad I'm playing the Cheshire Cat in the DR of Alice.   Tomorrow I will be posting the book for June.  Any suggestions?
