"Edith, come here, I want to talk to you. I say, I think we should take a small holiday. I rather fancy one of these new fangled bicycle trips. Now, what do you say to that for an excellent idea, eh?""Oh, Bruce. I think it's simply splendid. I so look forward to tackling those steep inclines and rugged country roads. I love to feel the wind and rain in my face. I've heard the weather's very bracing in Majorca at this time of year.""Yes, well, let's not be too hasty. You are a woman after all. I wouldn't want you straining anything. Perhaps the money might be better spent on a spa day and a trip to the theatre. Yes, I've made my mind up. It would be healthier for you, and improving for your mind."Holidays, Ottley style.
