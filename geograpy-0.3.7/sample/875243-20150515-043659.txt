Marlo,
What version of Firefox do you have? I am SURE there's a way to get it to work how you want it to. What kind of tablet do you have, and does it have buttons you can program? Any time I hear someone (in particular my boyfriend) say they wish Firefox did this and that my ears perk up, because I've found there's nearly always a way to work around to get what you want.

I find myself using the pen or mouse that came with it too. I can set it in my lap, which I can't do with my normal mouse. It's much more comfortable. That, and I can draw with it!

Chip,
It's a wacom, and I'm wonderfully happy with it so far. It was so easy to install, which is a good sign in a new piece of equipment. I hate when companies make things complicated, and add 50 steps to get things set up. I plugged it in, and installed the driver with the CD. This is how it SHOULD be. I got an Intuos 4x5, here's the page with all the specs: http://wacom.com/productinfo/4x5.cfm

Thanks Bronwyn, happy birthday to you too
