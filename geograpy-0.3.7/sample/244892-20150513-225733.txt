So here's the deal on this book,A pastor friend of mine quoted this author on his blog.  I thought "that's interesting, and I've never heard of that preacher before."  So then, off I went to find out more about him.Turns out he is a 19th century evangelical preacher with several books of commentary and devotional sermons to his credit.  This one on the prayers of Paul caught my attention as being interesting and short (and thus an ideal sample to find out how difficult his writing style is to read out loud).He is very easy to read, and his reflections on these prayers is thoughtful and challenging.It has been a very quick read, and I'm sure it will be a rather quick listen as well for anyone interested in DPLing.MaryAnn
