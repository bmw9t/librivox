Please read the poem and post what type of recorder you are using as well as any post-recording processing you used on the file to improve the quality. Many recorders have pre-set bit rates and sample rates so please make sure it is submitted in Bit Rate: 128 kbps; Sample Rate: 44.1 kHz.I use razor lame to convert to the correct rates.Begin your reading with the abbreviated LibriVox disclaimer: Quote:“Written in March by William Wordsworth read for librivox.org by [your name] on [your recording device].”Then read the poem: Quote:THE cock is crowing,   The stream is flowing,   The small birds twitter,   The lake doth glitter The green field sleeps in the sun;   The oldest and youngest   Are at work with the strongest;   The cattle are grazing,   Their heads never raising; There are forty feeding like one!   Like an army defeated   The snow hath retreated,   And now doth fare ill   On the top of the bare hill; The plowboy is whooping- anon-anon:   There's joy in the mountains;   There's life in the fountains;   Small clouds are sailing,   Blue sky prevailing; The rain is over and gone! At the end of your reading, leave a space and then say:Quote:End of poem.
