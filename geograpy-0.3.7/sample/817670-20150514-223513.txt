If you are holding it and that low, there could be a couple other things to think about.  Are you moving it around and this is causing noise?  Is it possibly rubbing on your clothes?  Is the cord or body of the mic rubbing on anything; this, too, will cause noise.Maybe you can build a stand for it by mounting it to a small cardboard box?
