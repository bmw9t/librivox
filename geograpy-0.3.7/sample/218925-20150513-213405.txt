How about calling it something like "Family Fireside Christmas Collection"? That will give the flavour of the contributions you'd like. I have sometimes had some quite dark contributions to previous Christmas collections e.g. Christmas in the trenches. Differentiating it in this way would add to the choice available, which is always a good thing! And the Multilingual Christmas Short Works Collection (and the Christmas Carol Collection) could both go ahead as usual without treading on your toes .Ruth
