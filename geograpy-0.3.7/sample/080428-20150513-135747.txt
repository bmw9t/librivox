Hello John, Section 6, 7 and 8 are PL OK   I always run files through the Checker program (http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/Checker).  For sections 9 and 10 it said the volume falls outside the target range of 86 - 92 dB.  Section 9 is 94.9 dBSection 10 is 94.3 dBI am not familiar with editing software as I only PL on Librivox, but would you be able to fix the volume on these and upload them again?Thank You!Tawnya
