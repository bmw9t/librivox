mostly FOAD letters. 

the usual process for submissions is to submit a query, a letter with 25-50 pages of the text. 

then if publishers are interested, they will ask for the whole manuscript. but if you don;'t get thru the first gate, you are not likely to get anything useful from them.

After many rejections to the query, Manuscript #1 is sitting at 2 publishers now, undergoing examination.

But in any case, I am more interested in #2 so I have sort of fogotten about #1 (tho if i was asked to I would certainly be happy to do a rewrite in order to publish).
