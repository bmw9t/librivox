Thanks Ron, good first official reading.   The volume was a bit high at 93 dB, we aim for 89 dB. I am not familiar with Wavepad, but we have a small program the spouse of a LibriVoxer developed to check the tech settings. If you're game, you can download it and use it to check the volume and other settings. It's here: http://cgjennings.ca/checker/Use the Experimental-0.9 alpha version.I see that Wavepad generates two different ID tags, the checker program will also convert ID3 tags   I de-amplified your file and the project is being cataloged.* I added your info to your catalog page, let me know if that is okay with you.You can view your brand new LV Catalog page by clicking your forum name in the Magic Window.
