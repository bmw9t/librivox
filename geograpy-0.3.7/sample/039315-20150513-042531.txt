Welcome to LibriVox, marydarko!

I spotted your note about reading something for us in Greek and I hope we can work that out.  There are many wonderful works in all languages, and here at LibriVox we try to bring as many as we can to our listeners.

It's great to have you here - it's always nice to hear a fresh voice in the mix!
