I have gone through all our m4b books and checked the linking - and so I now have pleasure in announcing that there are 531 works linked there - all valid.So let us all keep it right - I shan't do it again ever. I was sorry I started many times  Having looked at the wording of the link about 1061 times I am convinced we should change it slightly - we need to still keep the M4B bit "M4B format here""M4B format available" "M4B file here""M4B format here"Any other ideas ? I wasn't planning to change existing ones - or should we just leave it ?Anne
