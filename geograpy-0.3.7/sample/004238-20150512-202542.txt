There's certainly a lot to take in. I've been having a look through and gradually getting the idea, going to give the software a try later tonight and see how that goes! I always love a new gadgety thing to play with! I stumbled by when I was researching some fairy tales and found an audio player on the Little Red Riding Hood page on Wikipedia. I'm so surprised I haven't come across this before as its such a great idea.And yes, I'm in the UK, just outside of Croydon. It's interesting to see where everyone is from, it's a very international group of people!
