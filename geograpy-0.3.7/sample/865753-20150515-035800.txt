My post title may be a bit misleading.  I just finished reading one of the Tom Swift adventures, in the course of which I learned that Victor Appleton (and for that matter, Victor Appleton II) is a "house pseudonym" for the Stratemeyer Syndicate publishing house.  The true author is never given, and Wikipedia says that a number of ghostwriters were used for the series.

This indeterminacy makes "death + 70" a little hard to define.

So, our keepers of the flame - at what age do Tom Swifties land in the public domain?
