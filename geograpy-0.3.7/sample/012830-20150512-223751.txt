Hello to all the contributors, and very special people who make the Librivox world go 'round.  This place has been a great lurking ground for a while now, but I thought it would be a good time to join in the fun.  Hopefully you will agree...My name is Chris, and like most of you I have been a rather avid reader for many years, starting at my mother's knee before I had the benefit of British Army education.  I was a huge fan of Roald Dahl and Enid Blyton, Der Brueder Grimm, Willard Price and Tolkien, until I grew out of the first two in my teens.  I have since grown back in to them, as a godfather and uncle, and realised what I have been missing for many years.  With Dahl, at least!Lately I have been a fan of Terry Pratchett, Tom Sharpe, Arthur C Clarke, Jeffery Deaver, P G Woodhouse and others, but still return to Aristophanes and Mary Shelley when I am feeling particularly literate.I hope to bring a little piece of rural Devon to the Librivox family, and hope you will put up with me on the forum too.Kindest regards,CeeJam
