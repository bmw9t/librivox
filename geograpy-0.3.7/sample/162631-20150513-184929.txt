MaryAnn,Thanks for the feedback. Since I already have an iPad and you said people have had success using those, I think it would make sense for me to give that a try. I don't want to submit an inferior recording just for the sake of expediency, and since I plan on doing more Librivox recordings in the future, I may as well figure out now how to make them as good as I can. I also don't mind buying a relatively inexpensive new computer microphone if the iPad doesn't work for me. Do you have any recommendations as for which one I should buy?--Eric
