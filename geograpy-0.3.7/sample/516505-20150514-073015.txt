PL of Section 1: The volume is too low; it shows about 81 db and should be up about 88 or so.  The intro starts out "Vathek by William Beckford" instead of "Part 1 of The History of Caliph Vathek by William Beckford".  The recording suddenly ends with "End of" and the 5 seconds silence is missing.  The ID3 tags have the Album Title in the Track Title section and nothing in the Album Title section.  Speaking of the Track (section) title, there should be Part 1, etc. on those and should probably include the 01, etc. at the front so they sort properly in mp3 players.
