I have a commercial audiobook of War and Peace that I am really enjoying, so I suggested it as a possable Librivox project.  Because it had been taken up at my urging, I felt as though it was proper for me to conturibute to the project once it was moved to "Readers Wanted".  Also, the chapters are short, so it seemed a good next step after poetry.
