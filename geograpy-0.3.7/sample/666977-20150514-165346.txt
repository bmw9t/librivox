No problem, Smijen!

And thanks, bperiwinkle! It's a great book. I love Isabella Alden! I hope to read more of her books when I'm done with this one. I have to at least do the sequels of this one! 

I uploaded chapter 22 last night; I just finished recording 23 and 24. I hope to have them edited and uploaded tonight.
