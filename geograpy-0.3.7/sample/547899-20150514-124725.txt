Mim, it might be a bit on the quiet side, but when I tried to amplify it, it got really loud! I'm using Audacity 1.3.7; let me know if I need to do anything to the file--if it needs anything. Thanks so much! (And you don't have to give your opinion of my reading if it makes you uncomfortable; I am still quite new at this & will hopefully get better.)  Joy 

Proof listened  All okay 

Joy: I was waiting for another file of yours to listen to before responding to your request for input re: your recordings  and I think your reading is just fine   I don't think this file needs to be amplified, I listened to it with earphones on medium volume, no worries  Keep up the good work   I look forward to Chapter 41.
