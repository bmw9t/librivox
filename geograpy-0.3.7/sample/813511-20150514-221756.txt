admins share info among themselves if necessary for the administration of the forum and the system in general, i.e. enforcing the policies or discussing difficulties with the software etc. we arent too many admins at librivox, but we still need to make sure we have uniform policies and responses to problems. we don't usually share any personal information coming to us via pm.
