Ah, the ever-pertinant Chaucer has a poem especially for this post-festive season ... and thus I have recorded:

The Compleint of Chaucer to His Empty Purse
Text / MP3

I actually read it straight from a 1901 printing, but the online text version is about the same, though having slightly more modern spelling.  Hopefully that'll do.  Doesn't get a LOT more Public Domain than ol' Geoff.
