If so what you are hearing is a highly edited version!! The noises to start with were heavy BG noise low volume and vocal plosives and mic brushing, where something air or solid brushes against the mic's pick up. When I edited it the first I took out the BG noise upped the volume and removed most vocal plosives, also reduced the mic brushing quite a bit and came up with what you hear. I would much appreciate another opinion, also perhaps RS or TTM could run over it with their skillz?
