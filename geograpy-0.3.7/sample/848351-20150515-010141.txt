Praise for Cori (Cori Samuel) via the 'Thank a reader' feature:Quote:I have just listened to "Of love and Freindship" written by Jane Austen and read by Cori Samuel and I have to say that it was a really enjoyable experience, Austen's marvelous work was perfectly read by the beautiful voice of Mrs Samuel,  I then listened to Frankenstein and both were very well made, lovely British accent, good pace and expression make Cori Samuel one of my favorite librivox volunteers!
