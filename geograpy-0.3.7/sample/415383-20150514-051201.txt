wtomcho --You will see in the Wells text that he divides it into chapters with sections. So my Section 05 contains his Ch Second Sec 9 & 10. Also his Ch Third Sec 1 & 2. Your intro will go like this. "Chapter Second, Sections 9 thru 10, and Chapter Third, Sections 1 thru 2 of The World Set Free. " If you wish, say, "Recording by [your name]." Then say, "The World Set Free, by H. G. Wells. Chapter Second, Sections 9 thru 10 and Chapter Third, Sections 1 thru 2."Your outro will go like this. "End of Chapter Second, Sections 9 thru 10, and Chapter Third, Sections 1 thru 2." If you wish, say, "Recording by [your name]."I probably should have divided my own sections more sensibly. But I was striving for each of my sections to be about 5000 to 6000 words.The format of your file will be worldsetfree_05_wells.mp3.Hope this helps.-- dread
