I'm rarely up before dawn, too! But I'm in Europe so I can pretend I'm an early riser in a USA forum   In my timezone, if I am up during the early hours, it's usually because I haven't gone to bed yet!By the way, Max, regarding the forum signatures, I think if you add a url, it becomes a clickable link, so you can link to your thread if you'd like, or even directly to the youtube video, which I can't get enough of! A big hit!
