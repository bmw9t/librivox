I've forgotten I've claimed chapters a number of times, and I've always really appreciated the little reminder-nudges from BCs about recording or releasing the claim.  

I think it's good to have the text in the template - it currently reads "Please note that if we haven't heard from you for two months, your section(s) will automatically be re-opened for other readers."  But I'd still like to know BCs are PMing people before doing it ... and that they then aren't feeling guilty when they do orphan the chapter.  I think a week's notice is enough time for a nearly-finished project, mebbe a fortnight if things are moving more slowly and the BC is just following up old claims.  And it's hard, but there should only be one chance at it.  If the BC has to PM twice, after waiting the amount of time the reader requested after the first message ... the BC ought to be allowed to reassign it then.

This is where MC support comes in helpful ... means BCs can get a second opinion on whether they're being too nice or too mean.
