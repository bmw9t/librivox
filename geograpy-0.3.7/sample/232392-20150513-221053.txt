I think that your reading speed is fine!  Some people prefer a faster pace, some don't.  I think with the nature of the text, a little bit slower is fine.  The listener can speed up the recording if they want.  But if you really want to speed up your pace, you do not have to rerecord your work.  You can speed things up in Audacity.  It is in Effects, I would use Change Tempo, which will speed you up without making sound like a chipmunk!I will keep an eye out for the next section.  I am a little behind because I have Faith Formation starting soon, and I am the director of the program.  But I should get caught up after tomorrow.
