By the way, as another pre-recording question, the auto-generated form instructs me to not only give the translator's name on every poem, but his birth and death.  I'm not sure I've ever heard that even for any of the authors being read.  Is this right?  I think it's nice at the beginning (I'd want to add John's dates too, gosh he is a little more important) but this translator dating is even on the "short" form... not very short when it comes around every couple minutes.
