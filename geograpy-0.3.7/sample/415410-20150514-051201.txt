 Hi Bill:I understand that the first three sections have been orphaned, may I read section 00. Hopefully my reading has improved from reading the last one I did.I have been a little busy lately, but will read the section carefully first and then start recording.However when I start the recording I will start the recording thus, and I hope it is correct?Preface, Prelude, & Sections 1 to 6 of The World Set FreeThis is a LibriVox recording etc.Am I correct in starting it this way?JulesQuote:Always keep your head up, but be careful to keep your nose  on a friendly level.
