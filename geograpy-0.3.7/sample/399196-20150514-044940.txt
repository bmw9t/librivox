Thanks Jay! I see you're getting used to your new job - I just listened to the file and the beginning silence seems ok to me. It's okay if you listen to more than one file consecutively as you have the 5 seconds from the last one anyway. It should not be longer than 1 second though. - yes, there should be an "End of Preface" at the end of, well, the preface in this case. Bill, could you please add that? - there is no logout for the MW.
