I agree with you as to the derivation of Karls-Haven, though even a better reader with a native English background would probably pronounce it as "Haven", as in (Welsh) Milford Haven, rather than with the German "Hafen".

As a British expatriate in the US, my pet peeve is US readers who blithely assume that English placenames in Anthony Trollope novels etc. are always pronounced the same as their US equivalents. This is fine if the US reader is from Massachusetts, where Worcester (Wus-ter) and Leicester (Les-ter) keep their English pronunciations, but trouble starts even with readers from Rhode Island, where Warwick is actually pronounced "Wor-wick", as opposed to English "Worick" (rhymes with "Yorick"). The US pronunciation does some strange things to scanning Shakespeare's not infrequent references to the earl.

And please do not get me started on pronunciation of English surnames (family names in US). An otherwise excellent reading of a novel set my teeth on edge by its frequent references to "Lady Mac-Lee-Odd". In both Britain and Canada (and I presume Australia) the name is pronounced "Ma-Cloud".

Seriously, given that Librivox probably has contributors knowledgeable about the authentic local pronunciations of surnames and placenames down even to minor places like Wyre Piddle and Upton Snodsbury (these are not jokes - they are small villages near Evesham in England), is it not time that a concerted effort was made to gather such pronunciations into a standard list on the wiki? The present helps to pronunication appear scattered and not always helpful.
