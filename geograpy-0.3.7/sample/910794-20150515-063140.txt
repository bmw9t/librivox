With all the windows it's colder than the rest of the house, and I had to scrap part of a recording because I was shivering just enough to hear it in my voice.   Now I record with a blanket wrapped around me.  (You know you're addicted to Librivox when...)
That's dedication!!   I bet the wind we've been having didn't help much.
