It looks like Mans has dropped out of sections 2 - 6.

This project has been languishing for a very long time, and it is not looking very attractive for volunteers.

I will volunteer to read the remaining sections, and plan on reading it after I am finished with my current solobook.  

I only ask for a dedicated prooflistener, since Kmerline sadly had to drop out.
