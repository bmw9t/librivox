Hi Azuvil,

This forum is for people wishing to record whole books as a solo project. 

There's nothing wrong with having more than one version of a book, though, so maybe you could record a chapter in the Readers Wanted Forum or Short Works forum, get a feel for how Librivox works. Then you can always record this book yourself!
