It is an admirable tale of courage.brendan Sorry for the delay in PL'ing your latest, brendan--Section 07:--At ~3:05 the portion in red is omitted from the recording: "They kill our new-made Christians in our arms.  If they meet us on the river, they kill us"  (see near the bottom of page 119 in the Archive.org text link).  You did record the Google doc as written.So, brendan, I know that you have a difficult situation with uploads.  I do believe that the narrative flows smoothly in spite of the omission.  I wanted to bring it to your attention, and you can let me know if you wish to correct and upload again--or not.
