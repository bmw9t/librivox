Section 89, Chapter 92, 11:36, http://upload.librivox.org/share/uploads/lz/whitejacket_89_melville.mp3So, this recording was the first one I made using Audacity.  The software took some getting used to, but I think I like the fact that there are so many features in it.  I found that with the new mic/audio interface configuration I'm using, I have to amplify the recording whether it's in Garage Band or Audacity, but in Audacity it's easier to do that.
