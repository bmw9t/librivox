I have not recorded before for LibriVox but did do some work for disabled students at Florida State University.  I would like to take up reading The Eye of Dread if that is possible for a newbie.  Certainly, if Chelsea has in mind to do the whole book herself, I wouldn't want to interfere.  I have listened to her and think that we might be a good match -- not too much of a jolt for the listener from one reader to the next.
