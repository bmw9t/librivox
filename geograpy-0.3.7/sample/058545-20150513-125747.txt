Here is my recording of Section 0.  I hope i did the labeling and tagging correctly.  I am willing to re-record the entire thing if necessary, because i am learning a lot as i go.  (You can tell that many of my paragraphs are completely separate takes, so now i know to keep recording and do most of the editing much later.)https://librivox.org/uploads/alg1001/aestheticasscienceofexpression_00_croce_128kb.mp3Track length:  35:24:59I would like to read Section 01 next.  If that gets your blessing, i have a question:after i read "Aesthetic as Science of Expression and General Linguistic, by Benedetto Croce. Translated by Douglas Ainslie (1865 - 1948).  Chapter One."and then when i commence reading the actual chapter, do i repeat the chapter and chapter title:"Chapter One.  Intuition and Expression.  Blah blah blah blah..." ?and when there are headings within the chapter, you don't say "Heading:", but rather just pause and read the heading title like it was a title?Anyway, very excited, my first submitted section!~Lis.
