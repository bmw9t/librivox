(Ah, peppermint tea...very nice...)Hello again, trioptimum--I am so sorry, but I have made an error.    Section 2 has already been claimed by another reader, so I am assigning Section 4 only to you.  Again, I apologize--my mistake in overlooking the prior claim.  If you don't wish to take Section 4 alone, please let me know.
