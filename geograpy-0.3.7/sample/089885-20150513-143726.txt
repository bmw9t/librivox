Fantastic - thank you MaryAnn!Yes, I have been fighting with those plosives a bit (actually, a lot), and the little foam cover I put on the mic has helped, but I'll try experimenting more with the placement and angle of the mic (it's a desktop) to hopefully lose them completely -although I am concerned about losing volume if I start moving away from the mic, as I'm a naturally soft speaker.  Still, I now have MP3Gain and Checker installed too, so I should be good to go  Thanks again! Louise
