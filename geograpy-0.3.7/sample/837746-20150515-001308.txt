Me, too.  My chapter of one of E.E. Nesbit's children's book, recorded in my early days, has an appalling noise level, and I did start re-recording it.  But I know that it takes a lot of work to replace a chapter in an existing work. If necessary, I'll learn how to catalogue it myself, at some point.
