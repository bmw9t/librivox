Perhaps you were looking in the wrong subforum (e.g. "Readers found" or "solo")? Go the the main page and then click on "Readers wanted" (there are 2 subforums starting with this) and all projects there should have some sections that have not yet been assigned to anyone (you can see this in the 'magic window' (MW) in the first post of each project). Incidentally there might be a project that should have been moved to "Readers found", but certainly most book coordinators of projects over there would welcome your help
