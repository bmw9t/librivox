Hey Mike, thats a nice looking tool. I use Audacity and since i already had to download that and LAME, i dont believe i will be downloading anything else in the near future. But i hope it works out great for everyone, and doesnt ruin their recordings. But i am sure if you asked one of the admin could edit it for you. They have helped me so much, and i can never thank them enough.
