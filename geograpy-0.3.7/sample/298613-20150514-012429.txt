Gail, thanks for the catch!  I'll delete that and re-upload.  I agree that she was saying "age before beauty", relating to how long a family has had its peerage.  The earl most recently appointed would be expected to "back" his horse to allow the other to pass, since the road was so narrow.

I'll orphan if I don't hear back in a few days.
