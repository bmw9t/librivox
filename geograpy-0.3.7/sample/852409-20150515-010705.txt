I was particularly thinking of this app when I wrote the initial post: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/librivox-audio-books/id596159212?mt=8 as it seems to be the most popular. I also looked at Book Mower which seems to work fine, but the graphical interface on it leaves me wanting a little bit more. From what I am seeing there is no clear winner/app that most everybody is happy with .... I was thinking of writing an iPhone app with the help of you guys, who use it regularly to best meet your needs. I wanted to gauge how many people would be interested in a new alternative to what exists out there.The worst feeling in software development is writing software that just a handful of people use.Do you think you would be interested in such an endeavour? Giving a little feedback not just on bugs but how you would be able to use it as a whole?
