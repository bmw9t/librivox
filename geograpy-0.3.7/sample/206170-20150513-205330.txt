David, I’m sending three files for whatever suits your editing needs at this point.You’ll see the full Bella -VII with changes, and the full Bello –V with changes.  However, in case all the other parts of these selections are edited in with others’ voices, you can just go to the CIRCE BELLA_BELLO LEFTOVERS file to pick up the few sentences that were in need of editing for both parts.Many thanks for all your work!http://upload.librivox.org/share/uploads/law/circe_vii_bella.mp3http://upload.librivox.org/share/uploads/law/circe_v_bello.mp3http://upload.librivox.org/share/uploads/law/circe bella_bello leftovers.mp3
