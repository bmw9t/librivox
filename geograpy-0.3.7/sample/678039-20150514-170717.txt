[off topic] Speaking of pronouncing the word "the", I had a music director once tell the choir that the word "the" is pronounced "thee" (long e) when it occurs before words beginning with a vowel, and "thuh" (short e) when it occurs before words beginning with consonants. With very, very few exceptions.

Of course she was referring to pronunciation during singing, not in general speech or conversation. [/off topic]
