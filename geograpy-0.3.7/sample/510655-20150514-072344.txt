Hi Blake, and welcome to Librivox! 

Sections 14 and 15 are all yours! I have seen that you got an ok for your testrecording already, so - have fun! 

I've put you in the catalogue as Blake Cooper, and we can also link to a homepage if you like.. Your very personal librivox page to keep track of your chapters is here: http://librivox.org/newcatalog/people_p ... pleid=5298
