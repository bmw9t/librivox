I've renamed both your files. The preface should have been marymarie_00_porter.mp3, rather than marymarie_preface_porter (it has to be numerical, or it won't sort properly). Also, if you'll look at your links, you'll see that you have a double extension (.mp3.mp3). This means that audacity (or whatever you're using to record) is already adding the .mp3 automatically, so you don't need to enter it by hand.
