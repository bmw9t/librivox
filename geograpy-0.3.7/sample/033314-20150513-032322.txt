Hi everyone  I just randomly came across LV yesterday while I was Googling something else (amazing how many times that happens. It's a bit like shopping...)
Anyway, I live in LA at the moment, although I'm originally English. I'm an actress, I've always loved to read, so I definitely want to start reading on here (even if I'm not so sure about my voice). Hmmm, what else? Sorry, I never know what to put in these introductory posts, so I'll wander off and look for a mic now  8)
