Does this happen no matter which book you download to itunes or just for this specific one?  I'm not an i-tunes user, but I recall from other responses that there is something (like a triangle next to the file maybe?) that you need to click to download the rest of the files.  Apologies if this is totally useless information.ETA:  Found these links http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/How_To_Get_LibriVox_Audio_Files#Subscribe_in_iTunesviewtopic.php?f=23&t=39226
