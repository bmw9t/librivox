Praise for Kaffen (Mark F. Smith) via the 'Thank a reader' feature:Quote: I would like to send a thank you to Mark Smith for his reading of Jules Verneâ€™s The Mysterious Island. I thought it was superbly done, very clear and well acted. I thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish. Best wishes, SimonQuote:Dear Mark, Thank you sooooo much for taking the time to make readings for Librivox.  I have enjoyed listening to a number of your recordings while working in the garden, around the house patching and painting and doing various other rather tedious tasks.  However, I especially appreciated listening to Around the World in 80 Days last week as I drove alone from Calgary, AB to Winnipeg, MB.  The long drive was made pleasurable by the comforting voice of my favorite librivox reader - especially when I encountered icy winter conditions during a long, long dark evening when I had to slow down and began to despair of ever arriving!  I have just downloaded the Diary of a U-Boat Commander for the return drive and am looking forward to hearing it. Sincerely,Vivian W.All Mark's recordingsAround the World in 80 Days
