But thanks for the advice.  (Sorry about the bad communication/wording...it was like midnight when I typed that or something...)Thanks Haili.  Our DPL will check out the edited bits and get back to you.  Unsolicited comment: you do not need to make a new track when you stop and start again.  Control +R will 'append record' which just starts the recording from where you stopped.   (it may be Shift +R I'm not sure it's been so long since I used those actual keys).  I always append record to get one nice long tarack.
