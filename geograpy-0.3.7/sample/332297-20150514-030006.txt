Thanks, Hugh!   Yep, the print was a little bigger than Emma ~ that must have been it!I just finished recording the preface of the next one, so I'll probably try to get it set up tomorrow just when you log in and start looking around! Seriously, I don't mind if you find them before I PM....maybe I'll hide it off in Dramatic Works to make it harder for you.
