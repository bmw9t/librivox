Ah Ha... I thought you were submitting it to one of the collections (but couldn't think of which one). 

I guess the easiest would be to catalogue it as a solo. 

What I'll do is move this thread to Going Solo's forum.

You might like to have a look at the thread that's taken from (here). 

An MC will then come along (I'll see if I have some time to MC myself). 

I prooflistened. No repeats or long pauses but,at the very beginning, you should add The Gettysburg Address (before This is a LV recording ... For listeners to know straight away what they're listening to). At the end, you should say: end of The Gettysburg Address  and leave 5 seconds of silence afterwards (for users of MP3 players that cut those off).

Cheers,
