from the help deskQuote:First time I've ever encountered problems. In "Carol Norton's" The Seven Sleuth's Club, what is listed as chapter 4 is really a repeat of chapter 3, and what is listed as chapter 27 is really a repeat of chapter 26. No chapter 4 or 27 (which is the last chapter, alas.) otherwise, an enjoyable story.https://librivox.org/the-seven-sleuths-club-by-carol-norton/
