Hi! Hoping, I've got this right at last... All files for Norman that needed correction. Thanks for listening so carefullly!Algy, could you check the Google.doc for Chapter 5? I believe that "Indeed, are you not?" is spoken by the Old Man, rather than Norm.In Chapter 14, I think "I am tool inexperienced" must be "I am TOO inexperienced" (which is the correction, I've made)https://librivox.org/uploads/dlolso21/kingofalsander_norman_01.mp3https://librivox.org/uploads/dlolso21/kingofalsander_norman_02.mp3https://librivox.org/uploads/dlolso21/kingofalsander_norman_03.mp3https://librivox.org/uploads/dlolso21/kingofalsander_norman_04.mp3https://librivox.org/uploads/dlolso21/kingofalsander_norman_05.mp3https://librivox.org/uploads/dlolso21/kingofalsander_norman_13.mp3https://librivox.org/uploads/dlolso21/kingofalsander_norman_14.mp3
