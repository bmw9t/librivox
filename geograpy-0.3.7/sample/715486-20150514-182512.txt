'STOPS' or How to Punctuate by PAUL ALLARDYCE .

How to claim a part, and 'how it all works' here To find a section to record, simply look at point 5. below at the sections. All the ones without names beside them are “up for grabs.” Click "Post reply" at the top left of the screen and tell us which section you’d like to read (include the section number from the left-most column in the reader list, please). Read points 6. to 8. below for what to do before, during and after your recording. New to recording? Please read our Newbie Guide to Recording! Is there a deadline? Target completion date of this project: 6/17/07 – but try to send your recordings as soon as you can. If you cannot do your section, for whatever reason, just let me know and it’ll go back to the pool. There’s no shame in this; we’re all volunteers and things happen. I'm trying to wrap everything up before school gets out as I might not be in town much over the summer.Where do I find the text?
