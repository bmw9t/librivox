And Tricia, I uploaded the list as it was just a text file and the Uploader was accepting of that, to the server here.  Here's the link if you'd like to look at it:http://dev.librivox.org/uploads/bart/Place_Names_for_Pronunciation.txtIt includes some of my attempts at spelling the names out phonetically, please feel completely free to ignore those.    Thank you.Jill
