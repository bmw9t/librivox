Hi RavenousAddict!  Thanks for joining! Your username is perfect and you'll come to appreciate it more in the near future as you become your username here!!Here's a couple of links that might help for when you're ready to record.  Our format needs to be in mp3, mono, 44,100Hz, 16-bit, 128kbps and usually louder than most people think!      This is so all our files can be handled on the far end uniformly.  People here are very helpful and friendly, so don't be afraid to ask any questions you have along the way. Here's the Newbie Guide to Recording:  Newbie Guide to RecordingAnd here's a link that explains the 1-Minute Test Recording:  1-Minute Test.  You would upload your test and then post the link to the test as a new thread in the Listeners Wanted Forum.  Instructions are in the link.This test is of course not for any kind of audition purposes, just to make sure that it fits our format technically and that your levels are okay. Once that's out of the way, you can pick something from the Readers Wanted Forum to read and edit, or you can choose something on your own from the Public Domain and read that. Let us know if you need any help! Samanem
