Watashi wa Lucas, Timothy desu.Hajimemashite yoroshiku onegaishimasuI would love to DPL for you. I've never DPLed so I'm not sure about that process, but I will search the tutorials and think I can figure it out if you have just a little patience with me.   I am not Japanese but I do speak Japanese on roughly a street level so it will be sufficient for this commitment. I'm very excited to help out with this project. Maybe my Japanese will even improve a little.
