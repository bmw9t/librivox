Hi Michele, I'm sorry I've been a bit out of touch. I've been pretty busy this week. I hope everything is going well with you. I just posted a new up-dated version of Chapter 17. I hope you don't mind listening to it again. I was listening over all the chapters and this chapter, I didn't like so much because I think I made Perk's voice a bit exaggerated so I re-recorded the chapter and I like it much more than the other version.  Thanks again for listening. I have chapter 24 already recorded in rough but there are several places where I repeated myself on purpose so that I can go through and clip out parts and keep the parts that sound best as far as voice intonation, etc. goes. Well, that's all for right now. I hope you are doing well. It has been a real pleasure working with you. Best wishes...........Larraine.
