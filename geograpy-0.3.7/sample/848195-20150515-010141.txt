Praise for all volunteers involved in producing The Lord of the World, and gloriana (Elizabeth Klett) via the 'Thank a reader' feature:Quote:Dear Librivox Readers I would like to  thank all the readers that help to produce the recording of Robert Bensonâ€™s book, Lord of the World.  I have had a difficult time understanding the beginning of this book.  I am reading it for a book club.  It has really helped me to have someone else read the book.  I enjoy all the different readers and their unique styles and voices.  My sister introduced me to this web site a few months ago.  I think it is a  wonderful and helpful Mission.  She actually has read a few books herself for Libivox.  Her name is Michelle.  I appreciate your choices in  reading materials.   Most of the books I enjoy reading  were written before 1960.  I desire to read literature by accomplished writers with elevated themes.  I have just finished reading  The Odd Women by, George Gissing read by,  Elizabeth Klett.  She is  a wonderful reader and I do not believe I would have finished that book with out her help.  Please thank her for me. Sincerely GraceThe Lord of the WorldThe Odd WomenAll of Elizabeth's recordings
