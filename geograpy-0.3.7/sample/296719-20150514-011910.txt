George: I'm sorry, but this is too difficult to understand. There are a lot of stumbles, and the only thing to do, honestly, is to re-record it and speak much more slowly. If you re-record, then use the same file name, please. I suggest you read it from the Project Gutenberg text, as this is much easier to read from. It is here: http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2377/2377-h/2377-h.htm#wolfI am happy to do some technical work on it for you and even up the sound as before, but I can't do anything to fix all the stumbles, I'm afraid.Ruth
