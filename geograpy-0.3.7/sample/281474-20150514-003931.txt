I would like to remind readers that if you have PL notes and things to correct you should do so as soon as possible and upload the section again with the same file name then put a note in this thread that you've done so.  If you have problems doing this or want help please ask.  Sections that need correction but are left languishing for too long will have to be removed and the section opened for another reader, so PLEASE make the corrections, ok?
