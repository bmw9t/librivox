I'm not entirely sure how I should commence each section, that is, after "The Art of Fiction by Walter Besant and Henry James". Both the lecture and the answer are called "The Art of Fiction" as well. 
I'm thinking of adding "section 1/2/3. Walter Besant's lecture part 1/2/Henry James's response to the lecture". What do you think? Is there a better way of formulating it? I can redo the intro/outro without disturbing the flow of the recording, so changing the phrase isn't a problem.

Cheers, Julie.
