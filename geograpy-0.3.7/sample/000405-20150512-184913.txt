Hi, I'm here partly as a result of my adulthood-long habit of following the advice of drunk people in bars. Except in this case, recording audio books does genuinely appeal to me and is unlikely to lead to incarceration. I have a lot of music recording experience but spoken word will be a new thing. Looking forward to getting involved, this is a great resource!
