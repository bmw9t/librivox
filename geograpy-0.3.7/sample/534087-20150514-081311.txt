Note: I only put this here because technically that is what it says. However, I am pretty sure this one is a typo and not one of the normal misspellings and bad grammar in this translation.
3:37 - Isaiah Chapter 30 verse 25 It should be "have yet not heard?" not "have ye not heard?"
Have ye not known? have yet not heard? hath it not been told you from the beginning? have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth?

19:46 - Isaiah Chapter 43 verse 23 It should be "brought me of thy sheep" not "brought me of thy sleep"
Thou hast not brought me of thy sheep for burnt-offerings; neither hast thou honored me with thy sacrifices.

20:09 - Isaiah Chapter 43 verse 23 It should be "thou hast wearied me with" not "thou hast wearied me even with"
Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices; but thou hast burdened me with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities.

37:42 - Isaiah Chapter 43 verse 23 It should be "Jehovah of hosts is his name" not "Jehovah of hosts in his name"
(for they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves upon the God of Israel; Jehovah of hosts is his name):

Same thing as the last with the beginning and end(other than the silence, this one has the 10 seconds).
