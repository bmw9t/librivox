This one was nice and short. Hey, if I might ask, how do you place your H2? I'm still trying to figure a good position for it that avoids plosives and hissing/whistling sibilants. I tried throughout this one to have it above my mouth (which does avoid those problems and also avoids uncomely 'saliva sounds'), it just seems to sound a bit muffled to me (when listened to without headphones). Any advice would be really great, thanks heaps .
