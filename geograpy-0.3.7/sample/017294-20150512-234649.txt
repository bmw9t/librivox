Hello LibriVox Community,I discovered LibriVox by searching "voice over volunteer" in Google. I'm excited to be able to contribute what I can to such a great project. I've found, on occasion, that I get more from a book by reading it aloud than by simply enjoying it silently. It is with this passion for storytelling, combined with my firm belief in the necessity of projects that digitally preserve the great works of humanity for all time, that I come to LibriVox.Here is the link to my test file. Do enjoy the brief homage to voice actors that I couldn't resist including.http://upload.librivox.org/share/uploads/tests/test_tniles.mp3Feed back is always appreciated.~tnilesPro omnis mundi
