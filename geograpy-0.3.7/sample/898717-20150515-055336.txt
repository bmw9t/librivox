If I might make some suggestions ... perhaps put a little teaser for the story in the 'about' box.  You could also add "kids, childrens, audiobook, classic" and more general labels to the tags -- make it easier to find.  And finally, a little polite self-promotion around the rest of the web never hurts.  Posting here's a great start!  If you blog or tweet, mention it there, of course.  If you can find anyone who reviews this genre of audiobooks, you could drop them a line asking them to see what they think?  Do you have a page of links to all the YouTube videos?  If so, you could ask for that to be linked from the archive.org page ... some people will like to listen and look at the pictures too.A final thought -- I'd agree with Guero that YouTube probably isn't where people would think to look for an audiobook, so please do factor in listens at archive.org and the unknown but probably reasonable number of people downloading from other places, getting CD copies on eBay and so on.  Don't mind that people aren't listening in the same way that you do ... that really really doesn't mean that this book isn't reaching a sizeable and appreciative audience.
