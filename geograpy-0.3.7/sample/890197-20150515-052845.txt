Also, did it not affect your ability to type using QWERTY?Every operating system has ability to switch to Dvorak so that makes 100% of keyboards . I even have an old AlphaSmart that has that capability. And since I touch type I don't care what's written on the keys I touch. I was never able to touch type in QWERTY anyway. I switch to QWERTY (left Ctrl-Shift is my Windows shortcut at work) if I need to - for example I have several keyboard shortcuts in ArcGIS and for these I use QWERTY. Or when someone 'visits' my computer. -nina-PS Dvorak has been scientifically developed as ergonomic system for English language - many people swear that it saves their hands and wrists from RSI.
