Hi tedonastick, and welcome to LibriVox! The Knight's Tale is yours. Please read through the first post in this thread - there's also a reference to a Newbie guide in the LibriVox wiki. In that wiki you'll find lots more tips & tricks regarding recording on the computer, but if your tests worked out fine, you're probably all set! Any problems, let me know. :)
