Just zap that out and this'll be perfect.  (Also, I got a little disoriented halfway through and wondered why The Mermaid had taken such a weird turn and was talking about a little girl, then I remember that I was listening to you read Half Past Bedtime, and not The Mermaid. LOL.  )Edited and uploaded with the new uploader:http://dev.librivox.org/uploads/aradlaw/halfpastbedtime_11_bashford.mp3And who knew mermaids could climb trees    LynneSpot check PL OK. Thanks Lynne!
