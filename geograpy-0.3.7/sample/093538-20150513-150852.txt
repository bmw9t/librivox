Hi there! Welcome to LibriVox. We're glad to have you!To check your own volume you can use our Checker program - see info at http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/Checker Make sure you download the version released on January 28, 2014 - you will find the volume in decibels on the Information tab.  It's a good habit to check and adjust the volume on every file before you upload it because volume depends somewhat on how close one sits to the mic and how softly / loudly one speaks on a given day.Right now, the volume of your file falls out of our target range (87-91 dB).  You might be able to raise the input volume a bit in Audacity (slider control to the right of the microphone icon at the top of the screen). I can only get so close with the slider control, and after that I use the amplify feature of Audacity (instructions below).To adjust volume with Audacity, export your recording to an MP3 and check the volume using Checker (or a similar program like MP3Gain). Then go back to Audacity, select the entire file (CTRL-A) and use Effects | Amplify. The adjustment amount is the difference between 89 and your dB reading from Checker. Positive numbers increase volume, negative numbers decrease volume.One other thing: you have a few plosives, sounds which create a pop in the microphone. It's a common problem with audio recordings, and should be quite easy to fix! Here is the link to the LibriVox wiki page on plosives: http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/Improve_Your_Recording#Plosives:_popping_P.27sTry making these adjustments, then post another test. Use the same file name as your previous one, and post in this same thread when it's ready.  Thanks!Sarah
