Hi   Are you surprised to read my message here? I especially liked the bit about microediting. That's something I need to learn how to do. Recently I tried to cut out one sound (I think it was final "s") from a word, but I failed...Also, thanks for the explanations about the NaNoWriMo thing- I was kind of mystified by that, when I saw it mentioned so often in the forum.Finally, where did get that funky, folky  tune from?  I like it
