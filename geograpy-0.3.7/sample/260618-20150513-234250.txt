What ho chaps!I have finished listening to the last 3 parts and they are all fine. I can't get into the magic window as I'm on a phone here, so if someone could do that for me that would be great. The book is ready for the next stage.ThanksIt has been a joy and a delight.Arnieh - i should be able to finish the last part of your other project tomorrow. I've started it but it's time for bed here in this little Kingdom!
