Thanks, David.Here's the guard:http://upload.librivox.org/share/uploads/ek/throughthelookingglass_guard_03.mp3However ... in  Chapter VIII, the White Knight, there's a line that I think must be Alice, rather than the knight.   There must be a typo in the Gutenberg text.  I've not got a copy of the book, so can't check for myself:In the paragraph beginning "Alice ran to the side of the ditch to look for him", the last line is:-  'All kinds of fastness," he repeated: 'but it was careless of him to put another man's helmet on - with the man in it, too.'That "but it was careless" line must be Alice speaking, rather than the knight.Alice names the tune that the knight's song was sung to.  I've found a copy of the music.  I'm going to ask in the Help forum about hearing it.Peter
