Hi,

I am delighted to say that I have successfully recorded and uploaded Chapter 17; Book 2 of this title. The uploader did not work at first as I normally use IE. Then I used Firefox to upload. 

I am really tempted to use this post to claim another chapter from Book 3, but I feel it is better to quell my temptation till I ensure my first recording has been up to scratch. Because, if I made any terrible slip-up in my first recording, I do not wish to repeat them in my next recording. 

Awaiting impatiently for the green flag,

In-Spirit,

spiritualbeing

P.S: I noticed that a few kind friends had replied to my post in the thread for Book 2. I could not reply promptly and now I see that that thread has been closed because it has been fully subscribed. How do I reply them? Thank you!
