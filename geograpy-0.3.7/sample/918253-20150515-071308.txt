So if possible, try both these techniques.  (I'd like to give you more specific information, but which keys you press totally depends on the specific computer model.)In the past, I've had issues with a laptop where the CD drive still sort of worked, but not well enough to boot from.  So this might be a situation like that.Are you able to boot from this specific CD on another computer?  And is it the latest version of Ubuntu?  If not, you might have better luck with a new CD (don't know if that would make any difference, but it's worth a shot).

I only have one computer to try this one.

It's (I believe) the second newest version (was the newest when I got it of course!).
