I think she meant that we (admins) cannot go in to your Archive pages and do anything for you (shift things around, etc.), so it might be better to ask your questions on the forums at Archive.Even being someone who catalogs projects, uploading to Archive a lot, I have no idea how to move them from one collection to another. We LV admins use a script to get things to Archive, so those kinds of details are done automatically, without any of our own effort or knowledge.Hope you get it figured out!By the way, I notice it put it in as a VBR MP3. If you recorded it in Constant Bit Rate and uploaded the 128 kbps version, you can change that info when you edit the information for your project. Once you do that, it will derive into the other versions we have at LV (64 kbps, OGG).
