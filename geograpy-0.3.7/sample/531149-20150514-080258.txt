Dear maryjanemanalos:

Thank you for Section 30. I hope this is the first of many for LibriVox.

I am leaving the detailed proof-listening to others, but there are two minor problems I would ask you to correct on your other Sections. Firstly, your file naming is a little different from that requested; you were intended to replace the "##" with the two-digit Section number, not insert the Section number between the two symbols. It is not worth reuploading just to correct this, since the MC can change the file name in her folder (I cannot), but it would be helpful if you could correct this on future uploads.

More importantly, I would ask that you please indicate the duration of each Section when you post to say you have uploaded it. Our system has been known to truncate uploads without any apparent warning, and posting the duration helps to avoid any errors in this regard. Assuming you still have your original copy of the mp3 file, could you please determine the duration from it and post it to this forum. It is also helpful to post the file size, as displayed by the uploader during uploading - unfortunately, this file size disappears when the upload is completed.

I look forward to receiving your other Sections at your earliest convenience.

Regards,
David
