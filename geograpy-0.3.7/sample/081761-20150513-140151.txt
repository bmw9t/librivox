Thanks Dave C.  btw, I'm reading the text from a scan of an actual "Time and the Gods" hardcover book.  I've found that there are a number of errors in each Gutenberg version of the stories as compared to the book (e.g., word omissions, incorrect words), so I'm reading from the real thing.  Plus, it's just pretty cool to read the actual pages, see the illustrations, etc.The book can be found here at the HathiTrust Digital Library.  I wasn't aware of them until I did a search for the book, and found the scanned hardcover version.  Just an fyi in case you want to give it a look.Thanks,Dave M.
