Hi!This is not a claim, or anything like that, I don't know a word of Arabic (but I wish I did!)I just went through this whole thread, reading the various words in Arabic and marvelling at the sound of it, because I'm fascinated by your language. Also specifically the bits where you explained what 'tashkeel' is (I'm a student of linguistics ). I'm so glad that you are doing this project, though I don't know what it is, maybe one day after I fulfill my desire to learn Arabic, I might be able to understand this audiobook. Thank you.
