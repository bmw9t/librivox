Below is a link to my one minute sound clip.  Please review and provide feedback whether this is adequate.  The hardware I used included a Windows 7 laptop, a mono analog headset microphone that came from a Nuance Dragon Naturally Speaking program, and using the latest Portable Apps version of the Audacity program (2.0.6 Rev 2 it appears).  I positioned the microphone above my mouth rather than below it since it seemed I was getting my microphone volume up that way.  I haven't had this checked for decibel values.  The microphone was likely no more than 1.5" inches from my mouth.   The slider on the Audacity program for the microphone volume is all the way to the right.  When checking the input volume settings in the control panel, the "levels" tab shows the volume is at 100% and the microphone boost is at 0 dB.  My available microphones are either this analog headset I used or a bluetooth Samsung WEP460 headset.  The Samsung WEP460 was louder, but it seemed to have more background noise that I'd have to edit out later.  Also I tried to use the analog microphone paired with an older Windows XP desktop computer but the sound came in slightly quieter.
