Hello and welcome, Gambit! 

Well, you will be popular here. Everyone seems to go crazy for Scottish accents, and we don't have enough readers from north of the border. 

You have done extremely well. Bit rate, sample rate, mono channel are all correct. Volume is just right. Hardly any background noise, and a clear, well-paced and expressive reading.  Well done! 

How would you like to be credited in the catalogue? This can be your forum name, your real name or something else. We can also link to a personal web page, if you wish.

PS The only thing I noticed was the title ID tag, which has come out as the file name, instead of "Through the Wood - Read by HM", but I can change that at cataloguing time. It may be the software you used that did that.
