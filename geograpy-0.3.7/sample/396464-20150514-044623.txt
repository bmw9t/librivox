All audio files can be found on our catalog page: http://librivox.org/myths-and-legends-myths-of-babylonia-and-assyria-by-donald-alexander-mackenzie/ Quote:Donald Alexander Mackenzie (1873 – March 2, 1936) was a Scottish journalist and prolific writer on religion, mythology and anthropology in the early 20th century. His works included Indian Myth and Legend, Celtic Folklore and Myths of China and Japan.As well as writing books, articles and poems, he often gave lectures, and also broadcast talks on Celtic mythology.This volume deals with the myths and legends of Babylonia and Assyria, and as these reflect the civilization in which they developed, a historical narrative has been provided, beginning with the early Sumerian Age and concluding with the periods of the Persian and Grecian Empires. Over thirty centuries of human progress are thus passed under review.(Summary extracted from Wikipedia and the Preface of this book) "Myths of Babylonia and Assyria" is part of Mackenzie's "Myths and Legends" series.How to claim a part, and 'how it all works' here To find a section to record, simply look at point 5. below at the sections.

We ask that you submit your recorded sections within 1-2 months of placing your claim (or by the target completion date, whatever is sooner).
