Thanks Elli! 

I got a Zoom H2. I wanted to get something better then what I have, and decided on the H2 since it comes highly recommended around here, and it is portable - which I really like. Now I don't have to record at the computer. 

Still working out the kinks, but I'm getting the hang of it now and I'm glad I got it. (Have to consider it an early Christmas present for myself  ) . 

Glad to hear that you think it sounds good!
