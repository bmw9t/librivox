Looking forward to a wonderful year of recording stories in my voice and sharing my rhythms and frequency with the world.  I'm fascinated with this opportunity.  I hope never to resolve that I Suck at this.  I saw they list people by most posts, if you want to see that and who has been a member the longest, if you want to see that.  I also currently was the last who joined reigning in at 19857.  And it seems everyday people are joining.  Is there a list of who has the most recordings or minutes of airtime or something like, largest contributor in English, in German, etc. etc.
