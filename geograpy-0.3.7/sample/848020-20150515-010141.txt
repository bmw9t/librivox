Thank you.again.a very awesome.job LynnQuote:Dear Librivox and Ruth Golding, I want to thank you for the inspired performance of Emily Bronte’s Wuthering Heights (http://librivox.org/wuthering-heights-by-emily-bronte-2/). The experience from start to finish was a great pleasure and I thought Ms. Golding’s passionate reading made each character three-dimensional and the story conscious. I have very fond memories of this book from the time I read it in high-school. Ms. Golding did not disappoint my already high expectations.Many thanks,MelissaAll of Ruth's recordings
