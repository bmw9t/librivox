A bit of background information, mostly from Wikipedia; 

Stephen Crane (November 1, 1871 â€“ June 5, 1900) was an American novelist, short story writer, poet and journalist, most recognized for his 1895 Civil War novel The Red Badge of Courage. Prolific throughout his short life, he wrote notable works in the Realist tradition as well as early examples of American Naturalism and Impressionism. He is recognized by modern critics as one of the most innovative writers of his generation.

The poetic style used in both of his books of poetry, The Black Riders and Other Lines and War is Kind, was unconventional for the time in that it was written in free verse without rhyme, meter, or even titles for individual works and employed allegory, dialectic and narrative situations.
