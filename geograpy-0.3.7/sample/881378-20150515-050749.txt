Thank you for pointing this out, Buddybear. 

It sounds like an edit has been put in the wrong place. Also the following bit "Miss Lucas perceived him etc" is then repeated.

I am sure Karen will be along as soon as she can to put this right, though, as you will appreciate, it is a busy time of year. 

Thanks again.

Ruth
