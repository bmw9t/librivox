Yes, Lars, we are certainly looking at typos here - hey, I want this to be perfect! Thanks for your correction!   And I hope you'll be more successful in the future with respect to finding Swedish readers (I'm doing my best here...)Thanks for PLing, Petra! And, well, the fish/poison thingy is also a mere typo, right?
