I've uploaded "O Worship the King"!"All Things Bright and Beautiful" would be a great one!  (That's providing that I can sing it, of course.)  For some reason, that's one that I've heard frequently but have rarely sung.  I'll add it to my list to try!I have to confess that I've never heard "Who Would True Valor See", but it looks and sounds intriguing.  I'll play the music for a few days and see if I can learn it well enough to sing it. Thanks for the suggestions and feel free to offer more!  I have a whole list that I'd like to do (if this first volume goes well), but when they're all favorites, it's hard to prioritize.  So far, I've taken the easy route--starting at the beginning of my hymn book and continuing sequentially through the ones I know.    But I'm happy to skip around a little.I was shocked to find that both "Great Is Thy Faithfulness" and "How Great Thou Art" are still under copyright.  I thought those had been around forever.   bookAngel7
