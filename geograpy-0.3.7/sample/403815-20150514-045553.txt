Jenny,I am attaching chapter 18 again.  I had saved the change in it yesterday.  I amplified it as much as the program would let me today.  Unless you know another way for me to amplify it.  However, I listened to it and I believe that my voice is beginning to sound a little distorted.  The recording sounds loud enough on my computer.  I don't know what else to do?  Hopefully this is good, if not do you have any suggestions?    http://upload.librivox.org/share/uploads/rd/thecrimsonfairybook_18_lane.mp3
