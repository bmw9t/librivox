Hello Masa san,I had to think about it a few days. As I wrote in the previous discussion, I'm not very comfortable with "dropping recordings", just because they have not been PL-ed yet in a mere 4 weeks time. That doesn't feel very friendly or "Librivoxy" to me, and 4 weeks is really not very long in online Librivox time, in my opinion. Although I understand that you would like to have a new collection catalogued every month, and I can see that that is also fun for many readers. I was thinking about a compromise that we perhaps could try out: - the recordings are not dropped, but are moved by the BC to the next collection (so not the reader but the BC does this) - all that needs to be done is copy & paste the information and the url.- the MC then helps to try and find a PL-er for those sections that are moved.- the MC can update the ID3 tags to the right number at time of cataloguing, that is not a big deal.This feels better to me than dropping recordings.Shall we try this out? And then also perhaps in the future collections try out what time-limit is reasonable. I think 4 weeks is not very long for the more uncommon or "difficult" languages, but perhaps other people disagree.Anna
