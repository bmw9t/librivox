kmerline and other wonderful readers,

I have greedily taken many chapters here BUT since it is moving more swiftly than I'd expected ... and since I do NOT want to hold things up for finishing/release ... I'll relinquish some here and there for others to take.

Please start by putting Chapter 69 back into the "available" pool.

Holidays are coming, which means kids home from school, which means less time in the near future for me to work on LV material.

Thanks, Laura
