Hi there,Aravis (sounds muskateerish?) said it might be a good idea to introduce myself here.Well then, I looked for new material for my ipod and found this page. After listening to "The Princess and the goblin" I looked for the audiobook in German and guess what there isn't one. So I bought the book and read it to my children. Librivox is a great idea and I hope it will work out that I might contribute some german translations of some great childrens books. Anyho, the next days I will check my technical equipment (which is very basic) and do some tests.CheersCunar
