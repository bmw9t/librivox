Hi,

Thanks for your quick response! It is 23 min., 45 seconds. How do I clean the background noise? I was in a quiet room, so I don't know what the noise would be. How do I fix the plosives? I will try playing around with the microphone so I can improve it in Ch. 15. Do I need to re-record it? 

I would like to go as rivka in the catalogue.

Thanks,

rivka
