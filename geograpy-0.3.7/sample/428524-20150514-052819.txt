HI Amy, I'm back from work and I have set up the database for you. I have given you 25 sections for now, but we can change that easily (adding/deleting at the end of the table). Personally I would keep the "seven follies" as presented in the beginning of the book apart. There are still people who are trying to trisect angles, for crying out loud! Later on it's fine to combine chapters, as they will be very short - especially the parts that were added in the second edition. But again, it's your book...   I am still sticking to my claim of the first three mathematical follies though! I can't promise overly quick turnaround, but they will be done certainly!
