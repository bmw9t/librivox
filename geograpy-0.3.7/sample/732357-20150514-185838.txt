No, I don't think it affects the listenability. I'd say go ahead and just leave it as it is. It probably was just more noticeable because in this chapter there were several bunched up together, when the Miss Browning's were talking, and then after Mr. Gibson came in to talk to the older Miss Browning.

I'll prooflisten Chapter 55 and Chapter 56  

I'll leave Chapter 60 for someone else to prooflisten as I was the reader of it, and new ears would probably pick up errors easier than my own.
