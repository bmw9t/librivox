I recently joined the forum and am very excited to get started. I do not have any experience with audio book recording, but I do enjoy reading quite a bit, both to myself and my daughter.Meticulous proofing of documents is a big part of my professional life.  I also have a fair amount of recording gear from working with music. My hope is that my background in these areas will help me to make a positive contribution. It will take me a bit to get through the new user documentation and figure out my way around the forum, but I look forward to working with some of you soon.-Jason
