Sorry to be confusing, Giles!  The magic window here simply reflects what has been recorded and submitted to this collection already.  The wiki page has underlined all the stories which have been read at least once.

That said, Pandemic hasn't yet been completed by anyone.  Also, the impetus to create a Sci-fi collection in the first place, came when three of us independently recorded the same short story and looked around for somewhere to submit it.    One went into the Short Fiction collection, one into Vol 1 of Sci-fi and one into Vol 2.  All of which is to say that it doesn't really matter what you pick, as long as you're interested enough to record it.  

I would like to hear someone do: Unborn Tomorrow just 'cos it's fun, and The Coming of the Ice because it's the oldest of the Modern Sci-fi.
