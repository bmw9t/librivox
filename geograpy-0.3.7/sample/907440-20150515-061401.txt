English Andrew wrote:Are we Brits breaking the law if we listen to foreigners' recordings of the KJV or Book of Common Prayer? We are if we download recordings that are copyright in our country (although, in practice, who's to know and, unless commercial interests are directly threatened, who cares?) but does this apply to letters patent also?The wikipedia article doesn't cite the source for that rule/law, but if the law says "printing" (as opposed to, say, "reproduction") then one might argue that the authorization is only needed for "printing", the meaning of which would be defined by the law or precedents, which may or may not include a recording. (probably not, but you never know)
