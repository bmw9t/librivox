Have you edited a Dramatic reading before?  If not, I suggest that you take on one of the stories here:  viewtopic.php?f=27&t=48419 before you sign up to do a whole book.  That way you'll know what you're getting yourself into.  Just post in the thread as to which one you are doing, Rapunzelina has stepped in to edit because Frances doesn't have time now that the parts are recorded.  I'm sure Rapunzelina will be happy to share the work.MaryAnn
