Sure, why not - I'm ok with that 

This is such fun to read, makes me wish I had time to sit and do more at once. I am thinking now that when I've finished, I can play it to my own little boys at bed time so I can flake out on their beds till lights out time, instead of sitting up and concentrating on reading well!
