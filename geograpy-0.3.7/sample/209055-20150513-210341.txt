Hi there chymocles,I see that the link you've cited in your post says"The text is in the public domain. Indentation of the middle lines of stanzas has been omitted due to limitations of html. Markup is copyright Â© 1995 University of Oregon; this version is distributed for nonprofit use only."That last sentence there could be a problem as Librivox recordings can be used  for any reason, not just non profit.Here is a link to the Faerie Queene on PG:http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15272Good luck with your project, an MC will be along soon to advise you further.Betty
