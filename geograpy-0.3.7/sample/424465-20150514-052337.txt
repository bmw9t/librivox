Hi Michelle,Lesson 4 is PL OK   Section 10 has the end missing. It looks like you turned the page and didn't finish the L words on page 117: Larva-Lycosae. It is one quarter of the page. Please read that quickly and get it back to me.There is a misplaced repeat of "lamina-a plate" to be cut out at 29:47 to 29:49.Please bang out the last of this today and make the correction so we can finish this up. It is only fair to the rest of the readers and the people waiting to listen to this. Thanks,-Amy
