Hokuspokus wrote:"A Song of Ice and Fire" is great. I absolutely love it. And it's one of the few book my hubby and I agree about.They have it as audio book at Audible (in German). I got it as special gift for free from PC magazine we get every month. And know what: I have heard many LV recordings that are far far better...

"A Song of Ice and Fire" is one of my all time favorites! I'm rereading it for the umpteenth time and still discover small details I missed (or forgot) before. There'll soon be a sequel... if they ever decide to publish it! It's been postponed for almost a year now. 
The audiobooks must be awesome! I plan on getting them one day... though I'm yet undecided if I want them in English or German.

Btw. I just listened to a commercial recording of "Das Parfum" by Patrick Süßkind.... the story is great but the recording made me wish I could do the whole thing over...
