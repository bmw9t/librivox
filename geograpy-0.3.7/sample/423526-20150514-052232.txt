I wondered, since it's the beginning of the story, (after the preface that is) would you consider redoing that to say part one? That would keep it in line with the section numbers, the links and ID tags. The reading itself is spot on. But what misery in the story already..BettyThanks BettyI will fix the intro - it should be part one.I am glad you could comprehend the dialogue.  When I essay those outlandish voices I am never sure how intelligible they are.As for misery - we ain't even started!CheersAlgy
