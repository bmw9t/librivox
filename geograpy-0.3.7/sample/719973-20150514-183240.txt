Lovecraft's public domain works are usually available on Dagonbytes (http://www.dagonbytes.com/thelibrary/lo ... index.html), but the site goes up and down.  I've always wanted to do a Lovecraft PD collection, but Dagonbytes is really not reliable enough.

It seems to be up at the moment, so sjmarky, you may want to pop over and print out a copy for yourself.  If you've got hard copies of Lovecraft collections hanging around the house, don't read from them.  Whoever published the book will have changed the odd word here and there, so that particular "interpretation" will be copyrighted to them.

EDIT: STOP THE PRESSES:  Looking closer, Dagonbytes says "Written in September of 1922, Published in February of 1924 in Weird Tales."  So this one's probably off limits.     Esther?
