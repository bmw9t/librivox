Leo Tolstoy - War and Peace V - translated by Aylmer and Louise Maude

War and Peace is a book about the Russian Society and the Napoleon Wars. It is divided in 15 books. This is a long time project and this is the fifth book. The others will follow. The single chapters are usually short (about 4-10 pages), which is about 10 minutes  recording time.
