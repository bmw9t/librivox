You need to highlight the section (or the whole track) of what you want to apply the effect to.   I normally normalize my tracks to -1.5 db.   The normalize effect is a little tricky because it has a - sign built in so you just have to put 1.5 in the box.


Whether you normalize or amplify it's best to start with the loudest recording volume you can because when you amplify your recording, you're amplifying the background sounds too.
