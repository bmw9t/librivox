Thank you both very much for your advice.   I tried auphonic.com, and I think that will work for now, though I'll keep trying to improve my recordings.So, here's my next try... the only thing I'm unsure about is the volume, but I tried to make it somewhat more consistent.   Let me know if more changes are needed!The Raven by Edgar Allen Poe (1809-1849)Text URL: http://www.gutenberg.org/files/17192/17192-h/17192-h.htmMP3 URL: http://upload.librivox.org/share/uploads/tg/spc119_raven_jgp.mp37:59
