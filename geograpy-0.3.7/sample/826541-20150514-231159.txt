Hi Hokuspokus and Ruth,

Thank you for your advices.  Yes, it sounds good to join to the Multilingual short works collections.  I will coordinate with friends to do so.

Ruth, thanks for your comments about the copyright...I assume that as far as we follow the rules in the copyright on Japan page at the LibriVox Wiki,  we can use any story...is it right?    

Thanks again and please move this topic to Need help section.
