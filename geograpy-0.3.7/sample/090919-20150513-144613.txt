Hi Ben and welcome to Librivox!1. you have the right settings2. Input volume is well within range having 89,83. No plosives4. no dc offset, no hiss, if there is a buzz or hum I can't hear it, because of the5. noise. Yes, there is. Are you living ten feet from the highway? I think I can hear cars outside.Can you shut the windows or go to another room? (By the way, I hear your room, that is normally unwanted, can you get more sound absorbing material around the mic or a room where there are more of these materials(sleeping rooms are normally good with all the pillows, sheets and curtains)?Here are examples of what you can do:http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/Make_a_Portable_Vocal_BoothPlease try these changes and make a new recording. Then we can tackle any noise that may be left.Upload under the same name and post in this thread when it's ready.Cheersmahne
