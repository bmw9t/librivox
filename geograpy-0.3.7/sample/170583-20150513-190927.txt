Hey Beth, I would like to help edit these while I am here. I'm not sure how much I can commit to because I'm leaving in less than a month but I probably could help get quite a few done! Since it's all different narration, I don't think it's going to be too weird if I'm not the only editor. As far as pling narration. I can probably work on it. Yes it should be pled before editing. I could start with yours and work out just in case there's someone who ducks in to help pl. If you all, Frances or MaryAnn, would like some help with pl and editing, please let me know. Definately don't want to step on toes. But I'd love to help. If that's agreeable can I get MW access?Thanks!
