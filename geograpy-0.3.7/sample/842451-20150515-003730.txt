It's a perfectly fine recording but I suspect your gains shouldn't be set to max. Is the pre-amp working OK?
Have you got a link to the site for this pre-amp?
What you need to aim for is a large difference between foreground and background sound so with the gains up it'll be picking up everything. I'd get a little closer to the mic and turn the gain down. If you find yourself popping ('plosives) then make or buy pop filter or practise saying p without the expellation of air or turn your head slightly when saying p.


It's actually a nice sound but it'd be even nicer if that background hiss could be edged out.

Kind regards
