Had some nasty allergy gunk going on. Some better, but my voice is still a little scratchy, so my vocal re-recording I am waiting another day or so on...although I find myself wishing that there some evil scientist part that needed voicing! lol!  Thanks for your patience!This is now PL OK!  Great reading, Caprisha.  You're right--this was a great short story and you really brought it to life!By the way, since BellonaTimes was able to cram all of that short story into one file, I am adding a seventeenth short story to the collection: "Temperamental Tim," the story of a wayward, tough guy cowboy who gets into the motion picture business.  It's the first of an ongoing series of short stories.  A fair warning: my PDF of the story isn't the greatest.
