I highly recommend the book.
This was particularly interesting because there were often ENGLISH subtitles so readers could understand what "fellow" English speakers were saying.

Also in this very same connection, as JC knows, I too was in China this past summer, mainly staying in western China and Eastern Tibet. There are "subtitles" for nearly EVERY television show, so that no matter the "dialect" or language of the viewer, one can follow the "universal translation." Not unlike in Star Trek, most everyone has learned the Simplified Chinese characters. (The population, with all ethnic groups included,  is 91% literate.)
