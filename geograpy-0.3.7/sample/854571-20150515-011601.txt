I agree that most footnotes can be skipped. However, once in a while, I've found, that there can come a place in a reading (and not necessarily just because of a footnote break) where the listener would benefit by a repeated sentence fragment to pick up the flow again. I did a solo where the author went in for huge, long winded digressions in the middle of sentences, enclosed (visually) in brackets.  I finally slipped a few repeat words in at the end of his digressions to pick up the story where he had left off.  But that was a solo . . .
