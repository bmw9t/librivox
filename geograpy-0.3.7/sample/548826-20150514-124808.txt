Hello and welcome, aveazey.  I have put you down for those sections.

It's a good idea to do a short test recording just to make sure that all your settings are OK, before launching into a long chapter. Post the link here and I will check it for you. 

How would you like to appear on your catalogue page? This can be your forum name, real name or a pseudonym. We can also link to a personal web page if you wish.
