I've used 3 different headsets during the last year and the esses are really bad (well, to my ear - others are not bothered by them at all) on one of them. No problem on the first, and moderate on the third. I swear I haven't changed my reading style (in fact, I tried recording on the first one and the bad esses disappeared again). So, put it down to the recording equipment and don't worry about it ;)
