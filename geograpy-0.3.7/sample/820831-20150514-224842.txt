Oh, more Tagalog -- that's fantastic, April!  I proofread a few pages of several Tagalog works for Distributed Proofreaders (so if you spot any typos, it could be because I don't speak the language.   )  So I have a particular fondness for it, and am very happy to see more Tagalog works in the catalogue.
