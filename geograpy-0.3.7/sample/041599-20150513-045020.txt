Yes, Ava, I had thought http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/ and http://206.194.194.211:2011/cdm/landingpage/collection/ten might be useful too.I am hoping that the Mark Twain Project people will eventually give us some more information on where and when these articles were published, so that we can navigate directly to them.
