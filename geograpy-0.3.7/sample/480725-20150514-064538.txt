I couldn't resist this one ... it just came out today on Gutenberg!  Thanks for setting it up, Tricia.

btw, I used "Annonymous" not because I'm a poor speller but because that is the way Gutenberg spells it and the way it is spelled in the text, from 1664 (spellings didn't start getting standardized till after Johnson and Webster)!  

But we probably should list it according to the correct modern spelling, since otherwise it will not appear in our catalog with all the other Anonymous writers ...

Your idea about the title makes sense (though again, I didn't capitalize "unmasked" for the reasons above.  But if we can use the whole colorful (really, florid) title in the description, I think more listeners will want to give it an ear.
