Welcome to LibriVox! Thanks, I've signed you up for section 31. Please read the first post of this thread carefully.

Please let me know under which name or pseudonym you'd like to appear in the LibriVox catalogue. We can also link to a personal web site/blog.

Also, if this is your first recording, you may want to send a sample recording of a minute or so, to make sure the sound quality etc is all right - often things can be improved at the outset that are difficult to fix later. To do this, first upload your test recording:
Upload your file (call it "test_yourname.mp3") with the LibriVox Uploader (when your upload is complete, you will receive a link - please copy it):http://upload.librivox.org(If you have trouble reading the image above, please message an admin)In Step 1 you'll need to select the MC, which for this purpose is: tests - tests at the bottom of the listIf this doesn't work, or you have questions, please check our How To Send Your Recording wiki page.
Now please go to the Listeners and Editors Wanted forum and start a new thread (click 'New Topic' at the top left of your screen). For subject, put something like "CC - Titleofrecording by Author" (CC stands for constructive criticism) and include in the message: the link to your file and what type of feedback you would like to receive. Please note: In order to keep this forum current, requests for feedback on test recordings and similar individual files will be deleted ~ one month after they are first posted.
