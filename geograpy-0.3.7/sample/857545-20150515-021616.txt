This is rather a sad state of affairs, but I am not here to argue the legal points... I'm sure LV has full knowledge of the situation.And if it's true, then Audible is incredibly sleazy.  Imagine if I ran "Greg's Fine Steakburgers" restaurant.  Every time someone came in and ordered a sandwich, I'd sneak out the back door, run across the alley to MickyD's, buy a $1.00 greaseburger, and then slap it on a nice china plate and serve it to my customer for $10.00.  Unbelievable!Meanwhile, I can't help thinking of a parallel with "freeware" computer programs.  Often they have some sort of legal language that says, essentially, "This program is freeware, written by John Doakes.  You are free to copy and distribute this program as often as you wish, to whomever you wish, with the following two conditions: (1.) you may not accept any compensation for any such copies you make or distribute, and (2.) you may not remove this notice from any such copies."I'm certainly not a copyright lawyer, but I wonder whether there might be some parallel avenue for future LV releases, to prevent the kind of problems mentioned in this thread.  Of course we could not copyright the original LD text, but I believe we could obtain a phonogram copyright for the recording itself, and perhaps a separate copyright for the performance.Maybe at that point it wouldn't be strictly in the public domain; e.g. perhaps LV as a legal entity could retain all rights, but could then permit free downloading and distribution within the bounds of the above language.(Of course this sort of solution may have been considered and discarded when LV was founded, in which case there will probably be a reply that is a very interesting history lesson.)
