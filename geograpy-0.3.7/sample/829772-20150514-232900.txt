I've borrowed a netbook, and that just fits behind the mic.  My ebook reader did the same thing, but was more fiddly with the page-turn buttons (much like reading from paper, in fact, and not in the good way) and it was a faff to have to load anything I wanted to read first.  But both had zero fan noise.  

With the netbook, I've got a mouse plugged in so I can scroll on a mat on my lap, the mic is positioned about half-way inside the booth, and it sounds okay (although it's still a long way from being the El Dorado of recording setups.)  It's a little larger than the typical portabooths, I think ... is about 16in deep / wide internally, which helps.  Constructed out of awesometastic acoustic foam and a canvas drawer.  (I didn't have anything else large and square. Zero points for style, but since that's not a worry ... )

As I said, I don't have a noisy laptop now, so can't say whether this would block CPU noise specifically.
