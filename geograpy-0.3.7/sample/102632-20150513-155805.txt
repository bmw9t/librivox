Hello Ann,Just recorded Chapter 9 but there is a slight glitch.https://librivox.org/uploads/icequeen/submarineboysmiddies_09_128kb.mp3If you could just listen to the first couple of minutes, perhaps you could explainwhere the odd audio fault is coming from.It's not the headphone lead, as I now record with it behind my neck so it doesn't bang intothe mic. (Most uncomfortable!) Also, the mic is attached to the earpiece, so Ican't get it any further from my mouth, but I have never noticed these strangenoises before.I'm doing nothing different, so I can't figure it out at all. Feel free to delete from the server once you've had a listen!
