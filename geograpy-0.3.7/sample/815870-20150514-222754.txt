Hi Tricia,I will try to describe them in English. I hope it makes sense The first word, I would like to replace, is yderligere (that's used for "more information" and is equivalent to the English "more"). I think the word mere (which also is equivalent to "more") sounds better. The meaning is the same, but it's more natural for me to say.The other word is actually more a sentence - the Danish sentence: oplæst af. This is equivalent to "recording by", but a synonym to oplæst  is indlæst. So the sentenct would by indlæst af.Oh.. I understand if this is a bit confusing. I would just be sure
