Hi guys! Sorry to be so long getting to this- life has been busy and I've been having some trouble with audacity.However, with a little help from more technically-minded folk I've made progress. I've only today managed to record my one-minute sample which is now on the forum. Since I've finally got the recording materials going I thought I'd have a bash at these chapters- if there are flaws please do let me know and I'll happily re-do them!Chapter 20 (6mins, 49s)https://librivox.org/uploads/smijen/maryafiction_20_wollstonecraft_128kb.mp3Chapter 21 (2mins, 09s)https://librivox.org/uploads/smijen/maryafiction_21_wollstonecraft_128kb.mp3
