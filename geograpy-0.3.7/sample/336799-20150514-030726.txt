Congratulations Rob on completion of your first solo recording for LibriVox!  This book is now in the LibriVox catalog and available for listeners to download.  Please check the catalog page and let me know if any changes are needed: (Note: I didn't forget your cover art.  It will be added as soon as I can access the current upload page at archive.org.  Sorry for the delay. )http://librivox.org/basil-or-honesty-and-industry-by-charlotte-grace-obrien/
