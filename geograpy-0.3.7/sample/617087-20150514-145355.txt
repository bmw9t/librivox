Hello Joy,
Yes, isn't Tricia good at reading them!

I can do the odd numbered.  That would be fine, but I still can't get into the MW so you will have to post the OK's for me.  I will leave my notes in the thread of course.


There never are any notes with Tricia... 

Have a great evening, all.
Brenda
