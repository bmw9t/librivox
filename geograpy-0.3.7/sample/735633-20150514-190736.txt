Ok Ticktock, you're all set.  I went ahead and entered jemma's chapters but you can change those if necessary.  Hit the little "edit me" link below the Magic Window, and use the log-in information and instructions I'm about to send you via PM.

I changed your filename and ID3 schemes very slightly to conform better with our system :)

If you don't have server space to store the files temporarily (for proof listening, etc.) feel free to use my uploader (link added to first post).

Please let me know if you have any problems or questions. Happy reading!
