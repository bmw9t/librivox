Hi Stav,Happy New Year!!!I would like to start another solo after this one is complete. A while ago, Susan (WYSIWYG) asked if I'd do another Susan Warner book (the author of The Wide, Wide World), but I haven't had a chance to really figure out which one I'd do if I did one of those. I'm definitely open to suggestions and new authors. (smile)Bridget
