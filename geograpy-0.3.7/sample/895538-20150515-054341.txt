i dont think this question was asked before, and i was always wondering: what do people do while they proof listen if they do not read along with the text? i personally need to keep my hands occupied, so since it is winter time, i knit, mostly. or i play tetris online. or, as i do right now, i stare at the ceiling wondering what on earth my upstairs neighbors are doing with these strange noises coming from there.what do you do?
