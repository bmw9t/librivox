Anna, is there anything you need me to clean up before cataloging? I've never BCed a drama before. Actually I kinda did help with a few chapters at the end of another orphaned one.... but I didn't do anything else to that. Anyways, I've seen Beth unassign reader roles, and move all the regular files up to the top of the page, and then put all the of the readers on one file (cast of readers)... Would you like this done? I can do this if you would like, or I'm not sure if you want me to do that online cast thing...I vaguely remember that but you'd have to give me a fresh link and instructions. (I think that just saves you a step, if I fill out that link somewhere for all the cast).Anyways, those are a few ideas, but I won't proceed with any unless you let me know what you want done.
