Praise for usaeagle (Jonathan Burchard) and everyone at LibriVox via the 'Thank a reader' feature:Quote:Dear Librivox & Jonathan Burchard: We are a family of seven.  We do not have television and neither do many of our contemporaries. So, we read to ourselves and to each other often. This is wonderful and we have great fun doing it. BUT: Since recently discovering http://www.librivox.org , we have come to know and appreciate another dimension of literature. It's been such a blessing! We have had more questions asked and passages quoted (and miss-quoted) since we are able to listen to books we most likely would have avoided reading aloud due to length, or not found at all due to a small local library.  Thank-you all for this great opportunity to explore and enjoy books! Mr. Jonathan Burchard; we would like to personally and heartily thank you for reading Booth Tarkington's "Penrod" and "Penrod and Sam". You are celebrity material in our home! Those "story tapes" of your reading are trotted out and paraded in front of any visiting ear that might not realize the grandness that is Penrod's story.We, and many families we know, have listened and thoroughly enjoyed both of those books. We really feel as though you brought Penrod and the whole cast of characters to vibrant, mischief-filled life. And, we love every single second of it! We have laughed so hard we have needed to back it up so as not to miss anything. We have not grown weary of listening to either of them, and I believe that when your children can quote passages from the book while trying to mimic the reader that the reader has done a splendid job! Thank-you so much for devoting your time and talent to these projects. (And here is where we would all be vigorously pumping you hand up and down in zealous gratitude!)Thank-you again, so very much!Sincerely,Anna W.http://librivox.org/penrod-by-booth-tarkington/http://librivox.org/penrod-and-sam-by-booth-tarkington/------------Ruth
