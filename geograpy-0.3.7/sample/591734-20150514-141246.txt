Greetings (Is it Bookworm that I'm addressing?),

This is my first ever attempt to 'claim' a section, so forgive any error on my part. I'd like to volunteer to read Sections 25-26 'The Unlimited Power of the Majority...'.

Is this section available? If not, which section might I have instead? I'm happy to read another, but as I find Tocquevilles 'Tyranny of the Majority' concept to be his most stunning addition to political philosophy, I would be most eager to read that selection.

Also, should I read from a book, or a computer screen? Should I use Gutenburg?

As I stated, I'm a noob at this, so I might have some more questions along the way. I trust in your civility.

Cordially awaiting your reply,
Ryan
