I think I'm going to do another 5K on Friday night.How's it going for you, Michelle?  And is there anyone else doing this?

WOOT!  Amazing!  You are awesome!

I haven't been doing my C25K training...I had sinus surgery on 8/6 and am not cleared to go back to exercising till after Tuesday this week.  But I am SO THERE once I am clear.  I hope to start training again late this week or Monday next week.

So excited for you - I'll post as soon as I get back on it.

Cheers!!!
