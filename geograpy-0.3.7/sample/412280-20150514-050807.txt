Thanks Carolin.  I uploaded my test file and will make adjustments as suggested.  I used Audacity to make the test file.  I'm a voice overist and generally use ProTools in my work but decided to try Audacity and found it quite robust, more so than Twisted Wave, which is Mac recording software @ $80.Can I use my regular name Kirk Ziegler?  Or does Librivox prefer a pseudonym be used?  If so kirk202 or kirksvoice would be preferred.Sincerely,Kirk
