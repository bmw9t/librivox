I'm concerned about getting the names right.  I'll listen to ChipDocs recordings and pronounce the names as he does.  Failing that, could someone record a brief pronunciation guide for the names in 20000 Leagues?
You think I know how to pronounce these thing?  Heck, I just fake it.  I sound like I know what I'm talking about and people believe me.

While I'd be happy to record a list of names, I don't know what they are before I encounter them in the text.
