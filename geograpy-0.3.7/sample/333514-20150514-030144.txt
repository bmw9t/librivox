Thanks very much, Libby!  I'm looking forward to hearing your files.  Don't worry about the mis-named Act 1 file - and it looks like you've got it down for the Act 2 file.    Sorry about the mistake with the scene #s in the MW - that's not the first time I've done that with this project, unfortunately...
