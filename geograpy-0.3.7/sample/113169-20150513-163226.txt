I am not able to DPL, but I can listen to a few sections this afternoon.Sections 3-5 are PL OK.  I'll have time for a few more and will post further as I move along.There is a bit of occasional static - maybe from a loose mic connection.  I don't see any way to edit it out and it's not terribly distracting . . .MaryAnn
