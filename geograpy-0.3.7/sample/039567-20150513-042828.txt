Hi Jim.  It's great to have you here.  I think there are many people here who can relate to your cat situation.

Many of us are uncomfortable with our voices, so do not feel alone.  We have been reassured by the wonderful support of everyone else.  But if you genuinely would prefer not to do voice recordings, we could use a lot of help "proof" listening to content, so feel free to jump in there.

Welcome aboard!  

Chris
