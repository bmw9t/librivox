PL Notes Section 17All tech specs are good.  Nice clean file, well done.  Thanks.  Only one PL comment for your consideration:3:15 rapine, I've never heard it pronounced rap-pen, only as ra-peen, or ra-pine (as in pine tree).  Maybe double-check this pronunciation?   My thoughts on the essay itself:Paine wrote this in 1773.  The Federalist Papers weren't published until 1788 - 15 years later.  I wonder how much of Paine's ideas as quoted below came from the general discussion at the time, and how much of the United States he sculpted himself. He seems a great sculptor of ideas and ideals.  Some call him a "founding father", others just a "pamphleteer".  I lean heavily toward the former. How about you?But that which must more forcibly strike a thoughtful, penetrating mind, and which includes and renders easy all inferior concerns, is the UNION OF THE STATES. On this our great national character depends. It is this which must give us importance abroad and security at home. It is through this only that we are, or can be, nationally known in the world; it is the flag of the United States which renders our ships and commerce safe on the seas, or in a foreign port. Our Mediterranean passes must be obtained under the same style. All our treaties, whether of alliance, peace, or commerce, are formed under the sovereignty of the United States, and Europe knows us by no other name or title. . . . The division of the empire into states is for our own convenience, but abroad this distinction ceases. . . . Sovereignty must have power to protect all the parts that compose and constitute it: and as UNITED STATES we are equal to the importance of the title, but otherwise we are not. Our union, well and wisely regulated and cemented, is the cheapest way of being greatâ€”the easiest way of being powerful . . . . .
