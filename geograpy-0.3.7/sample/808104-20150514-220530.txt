Hi jennydisini and welcome to LibriVox 

Most of our recordings have no cover yet. Have a look at the catalogue. If there is no picture, there is no cover.
Links to text and recording can be found on the catalogue page of each recording.
You can find more informations about the books in the summary on the catalogue page. I'd recommend to create covers for books you already know.

More information about file format, templates and picture size are in our Wiki here:
http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/CD_Covers

You are completely free in your design. Have a look at our covers to see what others did.

Please note that we can only upload your work to archive.org when you release it into the public domain. If you prefer to chose another license, you must host it somewhere else, but we can link it to the catalogue page.
If you release it into the public domain, you can only use pictures already in the pd (pre 1923) or your own work.

Unfortunately I have no idea about mac but I guess that pdf and jpg are the same for PC and mac.

I'd recommend not to write down your email address in an open forum. You will get lots and lots of spam.

If you have any questions, please ask.
