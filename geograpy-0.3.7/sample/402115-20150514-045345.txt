Oh,  I did think you meant that Colville passed away...oops just proves I didn't read ahead..  I do hope you recover quickly. Colds are just awful, especially at this time of year. Hope you don't miss out on the choir or being Liturgist. Christmas services are special.Have a warm Merry Christmas. Regards,Betty
