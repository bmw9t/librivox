Thank you very much for your kind words, Loveday    I set the input volume a bit higher in Audacity and recorded a new version. I also used the checker tool, I hope it is ok now, but please take a look yourself. Here is the new version:http://dev.librivox.org/uploads/tests/test_rogthey.mp3Please let me know if thats ok or if it needs further adjustmentGreg
