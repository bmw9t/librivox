Also, I think the "batting average" is probably a better reflection of popularity.  I think Anne of Green Gables is right at the top of batting average but since it is pretty new it won't have as many downloads yet as the older projects.

I also suspect a lot of my P&P downloads are due to the fact that on my website I have a link to the zip file.
