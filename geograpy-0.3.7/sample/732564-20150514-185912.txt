My daughter is listening to my recordings and would like to see me put every poem, or at least the longer ones like Little Orphan Annie and The Raggedy Man as separate recordings instead of combined as they are so she can go directly from one to another.  Is this an option?

I read in the instructions at the beginning of Going Solo that we shoud block our work into 10 minutes sections combining chapters if necessary.  I supposed this applied to my poems as well, but my daughter pointed out that there are short poetry projects with one poem to a recording.

If I were to do this, would I be able to use the abbreviated LibriVox disclaimer that is used in the short poetry projects instead of the one I've been using?
