It's at 4:21 and reads as follows:This is no time for IchabodsAnd eheu - er - fugaces.Ichabods I have, the last line??? I winged it but if you have any direction, I will edit the line.http://upload.librivox.org/share/uploads/phi/sunnyside_26_milne.mp35:25I presume you mean section 26? Nope, sounded fine to me.  The overall message of the poem was enjoyable to me but I confess ignorance as to those two lines.  Ichabod Crane?  I do not know so you did just what I would do, decide on something and be BOLD about it.  Thanks for the section.  it is in the MW for proofing.
