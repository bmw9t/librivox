Hello, explodreamer! Welcome to Librivox!Your tech specs are correct!    The volume is lower than desired, so, please check if you can increase the input volume of your microphone, either from your system's control panel for sounds and microphones, or from the microphone slider in Audacity (or any other recording software you are using). If you can't increase the input volume before recording, you could use the Amplify effect after recording, but it's alsways better when we record within desired volume range in the first place.In Audacity, the visual hint is when the waveform peaks just above the 0.5 mark:or you could use the Checker for a more precise measurement in numbers. Desired range is around 87-92 with 89dB being ideal, and your current recording measures around 79dB.Increasing the volume (or amplifying) may bring up the background noise, too, so then we'll use the noise-removal effect: http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/Noisecleaning_With_PicsTry to make the above adjustments and then upload a new recording. Post in this same thread when ready, and of course, ask if there are any questions
