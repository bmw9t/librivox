I have been told it needs to be between 87 and 91 dB. Maybe Phil has some input here?LynneIt wasn't so low that I had to adjust my volume to hear the reader. If the BC is okay with 87.5, then I'm okay with it - let me know your preference and I can mark this as either PL OK or wait until an adjustment. I think it is OK...
