If 07 has the same issue, I'm wondering if I need a new microphone.  This one has been bumped around a bit.  Thanks for your suggestions and help.Chapter 6 is now missing the high-pitched whine in the background, and I'll mark it PL OK.  Chapter 7 doesn't seem to have the same problem.  It sounds much more like your previous recordings, and I'll PL it now.Just FYI -- I had a problem with a similar background whine when I tried to move from a headset to a desktop mic.  After days of fussing -- getting a line conditioner, a separately powered USB hub, and unplugging everything in my apartment -- I was about ready to return the new mic.  Then the people at Blue suggested that I take the mic to another building and try it.  Success.  There is something in the sound atmosphere in my apartment building that affects the mic, even though I can't hear it, except in recordings.  An electrician friend said it could be something as simple as a CO2 monitor or the lights in the hallway.  So before you spend money a new mic, you might want to take your existing one to another location and try it--just to see if there is some new electrical interference in your normal environment.
