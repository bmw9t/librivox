Ack! It's funny; I just resolved last night that I would go ahead and read chapters late at night (which is pretty much the only time I'm guaranteed to be interruption-free) but that I would edit the files and upload them the next day. Looks like that was a wise decision -- I can't be trusted to get much right so late at night. :)
