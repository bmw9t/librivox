This is not an audition, but a check that your recording set-up is up to Librivox standards. It is much less frustrating to have to re-do a one minute segment, than a 20 minute or longer chapter.http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/1-Minute_TestBe sure to read the first post in this thread when you are ready to record your chapter. There is all the information there you need. If anything doesn't make sense, please feel free to ask. I have assigned sections 3 and 4 to you.How would you like to appear in the catalog? most of us use our real name, but you can use your forum name or a pseudonym if you prefer.Lynne
