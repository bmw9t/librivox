I am a librarian working for the Department of Defense Dependent's schools, living and working in Wiesbaden Germany.

I have much enjoyed listening to two books so far, Anne of Green Gables and The Wind in the Willows.

I am ready to try contributing but will do so on the weekly poetry to start out.

One book I would love to see included is my childhood favorite "Hitty, the First One Hundred Years".
