Also, are you still having problems with The People of the Crater? Should I re-upload it?

I was also looking at the tags that are available for the MP3 files and suggest that perhaps the Author of the book should be placed in the composer tag (TCOM) and the reader(s) be placed in the Lead performer(s)/Soloist(s) (TPE1) tag (the artist tag, I believe). I was able to place at least 16 names into the artist information for an audiobook in iTunes when separating them with "/", as defined in the ID3v2.3.0 standard ( http://www.id3.org/id3v2.3.0 ).
