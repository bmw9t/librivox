When it gets so high that it reaches the top of the graph the sound can get clipped, causing distortion.  I didn't notice clipping in this recording, but you came close.  For future recordings, I would suggest either lowering your input volume slightly or moving your mic a little further away from your mouth.I look forward to hearing more from you.
