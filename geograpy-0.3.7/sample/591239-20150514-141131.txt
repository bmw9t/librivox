Tracy  - I'm helping out a bit and I cannot find your file anywhere. I am not a Mac user so am not sure about name lengths though it is possible
Could you try again - maybe save it as Beeton_020.mp3  then rename it , check that the name is exactly right , and try the uploader again . I sometimes have to wait a long time for the upload to finish but it always has worked for me .
The only thing I could think was that it fact somehow the file was not an MP3  - there is a limit on the size that will upload so if in some way you had exported it in a different format it may have been too big . If you have trouble again just check your file size - your first file was 38M
Got my fingers and toes crossed
