I hope we can get it done this time; it's had several starts already.Oh, hell, how many times has it been attempted before?  Now I'm a little worried.  Fortunately it's not all that long, and the short sections make for easy recording when one just has an hour or two to spare.Sorry I've not been active on this lately.  Been sick a couple of weeks and didn't want to compromise my health.I'm uploading chapters 30 and 31 right now for the second time.  Not too good at remembering to enter in the password.  It only tells you after waiting several minutes for the upload that it was the wrong one ... would be a dubious honor indeed to shake the hand of the individual who thought to do it that way!  Not to say that it's not wonderful that someone put the effort in to create such a useful tool, but it does seem that a few common-sense improvements are in order.Ah, it says it failed again because of the too-long filename bug which the silly thing gives duplicate files by itself.  Well, it probably went through anyway.
Don't be worried. It'll get done eventually, and carrying on with recording the odd section, as you do, is the best way forward! 

Agree about the Uploader - it's seriously lacking in some sensible features. However, it was free... haven't found anything better yet. If you know anything, let me know.

Yes, got both files!
