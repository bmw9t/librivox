Praise for amelita (Amy Conger) via the 'Thank a reader' feature:  Quote:I wanted to personally thank Amy Conger for her beautiful reading ofThe Game of Life and How to Play It....it's an old book but such agreat one and Amy...your voice is just magic!!!Also, I want to suggest that perhaps Amy might read "If You Want toWrite" by Brenda Ueland...I'm not sure if it's out of copyright orhow this goes, but it's amazingly inspirational and if I had thetime, I would try and read it myself....but Amy's voice is just rightand I hope it's possible for her/Librivox to do it.Love you Librivox!ClareAll of Amy's recordings
