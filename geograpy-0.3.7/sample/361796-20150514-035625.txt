One last question about the cast.  Do you want me to read each character name or leave a space after I read "Narrator read by Amanda Friday" and you will use their "read by" statements to fill out the cast list?Option A:Me:  "Cast of Characters" then I read each character name (but not the reader's name)or Option B:Me:  "Cast of Characters.  Narrator read by Amanda Friday", then 'So and so read by So and So" from their own introduction to their file.Does that make any sense at all what I'm asking or am I just confusing you?
