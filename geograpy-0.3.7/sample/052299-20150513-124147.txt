I love Sigfried Sassoon's poetry, so here's one I thought would be suitable: A Letter Home (to Robert Graves). https://librivox.org/uploads/annise/lavenderlit101_21_sassoon.mp3 (02:45)And here's the gutenberg link: http://www.gutenberg.org/files/45199/45199-h/45199-h.htm#A_LETTER_HOMEI also love Somerset Maugham - perhaps "Red" which is one of his most famous. What do you think? http://www.gutenberg.org/files/26854/26854-h/26854-h.htm#IVEDIT: I think I'm a bit over-committed to do "Red" - it would be a lovely addition to this collection but I won't claim it for now. I'll leave the link here so I can find it again in case no-one else does it, but I need to clear my desk a bit before I commit to anything new, apart from quick poems.
