I moved ch. 3 into a nice little directory:
http://librivox.kayray.org/uploader/files/twain/
And linked it in your first post.  If MF gives you any more trouble, just use my uploader and I'll stick the files in that directory when I notice them.

When another project clears out of my uploader, you can use it exclusively.  I'll let you know when there's room :)
