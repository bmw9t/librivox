All caught up, chapters 14 and 17 need an extra 5 seconds of silence since they are > 30 min long.  Rest are all PL okay.  Regarding my recording - I had a terrible echo while I was working on my test file.  My apartment has high ceilings.  Any thoughts on how to get around that?  I was going to try recording in different spots in my place to see if one has less echo than others.
