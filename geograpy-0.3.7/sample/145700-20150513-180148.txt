35 is a nice normal length for a change, but watch out for the next one, which I hope won't have to be split in two.BTW, the Appendix is between Parts II and III and contains two of his speeches. The second one is quite l-o-n-g! I hadn't planned on doing it but am reconsidering. If you (singular or plural) would care to take a look, I'd appreciate your thoughts. (I know it's not in your job description.  )
