Hi, let me start off by saying that I really like the librivox site. 
I'm an engineer, but I used to be a Computer programmer, I heard on the anniversary thing that you needed programmers.  I can do PHP and Mysql etc.  If you guys need help, I'd love to pitch in, just let me know what you need.  I've got a week vaction coming up, so I should have some time.  

About me... Well I live in Utah, I like to play outside and spend time with my beautiful wife.  

keep up the good work.
