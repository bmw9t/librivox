PL notes for checking!Section 32:~02:31 I'm hearing "was about the eighth and twentieth part of an Inch broad", in text "was about the eight and twentieth part of an Inch broad"~07:50 I'm hearing "will be border'd with the like Fringes of Colours when those Planes meet", in text "will be border'd with the like Fringes of Colours where those Planes meet"09:45-10:50 Repetition of Table (without the "parts of an inch")10:54 "1/23-1/2" from the table, I think it should be read differently. Here's the original scan. What do you think Ava?11:15 "1/18 or 1/18-1/2" as above. Also the "1/18 or" is repeated.13:31 I'm hearing "and setting down on this Table", in text "and setting down in this Table"13:53 I'm hearing "began to appear and looked brighter", in text "began to appear and look brighter"16:30 I'm hearing "which was all black'd over on both sides", in text "which was black'd all over on both sides" word orderSection 33:01:10 I'm hearing "at their inwards ends which were next to the Shadow", in text "at their inward ends which were next the Shadow"07:32 I'm hearing "And therefore the instance of the edges of the Knives", in text "And therefore the distance of the edges of the Knives"08:08 I'm hearing "where they are distant to 160th Part of an Inch", in text "where they are distant the 160th Part of an Inch"11:36 I'm hearing "of the Knives fall perpendicularly upon a Paper", in text "of the Knives fell perpendicularly upon a Paper"14:17 "another Light which begins to appear at i", in the rest of the cases the i is read "lower case i", whereas here it is not.~15:40 I'm hearing "by measuring the distances ps, qt, v", in text "by measuring the distances ps, qt, rv"18:55 I'm hearing "through a small hole made in a Plate", in text "through a small round hole made in a Plate"20:25 "was in the full red Light 1/37-1/4 of an Inch", the "1/37-1/4" as in the notes for the table of section 32, above.About the table of this section(~09:40-), I wonder if the second column should also be read "## inches", instead of "## parts of an inch"because later in the section, it says "[...] by adding to their halfs the line 1/2 mn, (which here was the 128th part of an Inch, or 0'0078 Inches,) the Sums np, nq, nr, were 0'1828, 0'3328, 0'4978 Inches."
