Michele,One idea:  If you click on the "profile" button at the bottom of one of your posts, it will give you an option to see all of the user's posts.  From there you can search on keywords like "cover" or the title of the book to narrow the listing a bit.  From there you can scan to see if you have already posted the request.MaryAnn
