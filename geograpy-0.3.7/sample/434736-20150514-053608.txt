Hi, Bobby!Your chapter is PL-OK and I have edited the magic window accordingly. The only thing that I'd stress is to try and take a longer pause between paragraphs; though your reading was excellent, I often felt like I was being rushed along to the next exciting point. It made for fun listening but maybe something to consider in future?Thanks for the section, it was particularly amusing at work...!   - doublemirrors
