I'll just repost that which I said in my initial email reply.Quote:What is something about yourself How did you discover LibriVoxWhy are you interested in becoming a part of our forum communityI suppose most easily to say about myself, is that I am a writer.  From a social perspective, I am aspiring, for the definition of such is success in publication and popularity.  Despite this, I find it more accurate to refer to myself as a writer, simply gifted with other things as are most other people.  These things I see simply are to encourage my own success on the social perspective of writing.  In reality, I believe writer's to be born and cultivated, but not created from thin air.  One must have the clay to make a pot.  It is not possible to make a dirt pot, and when one is made of simple mud, it can be found crackling and breaking apart all the worse once it dries.  Nonetheless, a wad of clay will not become a pot by sitting around, for it must be shaped and rolled and such is how I view the essence of a writer, as the attributes of further education and philosophical questioning assist in my self-shaping into a rather nice pot.I happened upon LibriVox during a search for an audio recording of Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift.  My English Literature course has required me to read the novel, but I found the text dense and difficult to process the plot along with the processing of the textual variance to modern English into audio information.  Thus I came upon the recording Gulliver's Travels-Read by Lizzie DriverI'm interested in becoming part of your forum community for the experience of becoming a reader.  I believe it will be entertaining, and would provide a way I could, in some way give back to LibriVox for providing myself with such a pleasant experience.
