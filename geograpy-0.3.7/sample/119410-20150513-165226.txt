MC's are volunteers with Real Life to deal with like anyone else, so the project BC will sometimes need to prompt the MC that the project is full. But someone else popping into multiple projects with these requests could certainly be interpreted as badgering. I'm going to assume that wasn't your intent.No, I perused projects in Readers Wanted the other day looking for something to read and found 3 in a row that actually had no Openings.  No offense was intended in my very brief remarks, just a gentle reminder so other readers would not encounter the same experience as I did. I've seen but never understood the FULL designation. No badgering was intended at all. When I finally found a project with open sections that interested me, I signed up and quit looking. But everyone's time is valuable, and it helps to know which projects actually have openings.
