I see that Algy has offered above to record them all for you. As Laurie Anne pointed out, if he also submits them to LibriVox (so that they are in our catalogue), we would need to know the source of your texts, so that we can check that they are in the Public Domain in the US, where our files are stored. 

Please post the sources of the texts (link to online text if possible, otherwise book title, date published, translator etc.)

If they are all out of copyright (published in 1922 or earlier), I imagine Algy would make them into a separate fairy tale collection, so they would all be together.

If it turns out that some are not in the Public Domain, they will not appear in our catalogue, so you will need to make arrangements with Algy for him to get the recordings to you.
