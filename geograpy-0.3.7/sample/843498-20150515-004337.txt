Would it be OK (she really wants to) if she recorded some short works for Librivox? I fully understand if you prefer not to fill the catalog with mother-beloved childish lispings (although MY CHILD, well, she's a GENIUS, of course), or if there are privacy-law issues with having people under age 13 submit files.If she DOES record anything, any suggestions? I'm thinking some Stevenson poems from A Child's Garden of Verses maybe, but a story or two would be nice as well. Are there any good short children's works in the public domain? L.M. Montgomery wrote a number of short stories which were published before 1923, but I think the only form we have them in is as books edited together in the 1990's... which, I'm sure, means they're under copyright, correct?

We actually have at least one very young child's recording of 'Twas the Night Before Christmas. We don't discriminate as far as age here. The only thing is that we require parental permission from children under 13 to participate in the forums, and that probably means to record as well. Since you're her parent, there won't be any problems.

As far as what to record...Is there anything she likes best?
