A question for all the teachers out there--Have any of you guys used Librivox in a classroom setting?  I'm thinking about giving students the opportunity to volunteer for Librivox as an optional extra credit assignment.  In a nutshell, they would be required to read (and get PL OK) one chapter, one big dramatic role, or multiple small dramatic roles.  All of the necessary equipment can also be rented out on campus, and I've directed students to the Librivox FAQ on the syllabus.  Has anyone had success with trying to incorporate Librivox in the classroom setting?  I'm curious to hear how it worked out.
