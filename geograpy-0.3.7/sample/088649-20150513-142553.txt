Francisco,Welcome to Librivox!You've got a lovely clear reading voice, very pleasant to listen to.Technical specs are good, volume is good at 88 dB (we target 89 dB, with 87-91 being ok).The only issue is background noise.   Make sure that there is nothing else electrical running nearby while you record (including computer peripherals like external drives, fish tank motors, printers, fluorescent lights, etc. ).   Then select a short selection of background noise only (no speech), then click Effect | Noise Removal and Get Noise Profile. Then select the whole recording (Ctrl+A), click Effect | Noise Removal again.  I use the following settings:Noise reduction: 7 dBSensitivity:  0 dBFrequency smoothing: 150 HzAttack/decay: 0.0Here are some other noise cleaning resources:  text instructions: http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/Noisecleaning_With_Pics video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFSg9o37HMwIf there is still noise left in the file, you can do a second pass.  We've found that it is better to do two passes of "light" noise cleaning (with settings like those above) than to try to take out all the noise in one pass.  I did two passes with these settings and thought the file cleaned up very nicely.Please try making this adjustment, then post another test. Use the same file name as your previous one, and post in this same thread when it's ready. MaryAnn
