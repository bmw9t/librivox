Hi Jim and Christine,
we will need to make some changes in the mw. Chapter 19 is over 6000 words. The reader, ChrisÂ 
, and I discussed the metter. We think it's best that it would be split into 2 parts. She has an idea how to split the chapter, but we'll need another section in the mw and when you add the sections, please pass Kara's sections 23 and 24 to sections 24 and 25. Thank you.
Stav.
