Hi June, great to have you with us! I have given the next five sections to you, but as you are a beginner, I'd like to warn you: Every section is about half an hour of FINISHED recording. It will take you about 2 hours for each. That's quite normal, so don't panic if it seems to be endless  Jing will post the pronunciation guide soon, so it would be nice if you could wait until it's up so that we have some consistency. If you cannot wait to get your feet wet, there are lots of projects in "Dramatic Works" that are looking for actors. Those are usually quite short, so you can get a quick satisfaction of finishing  However, I hope you'll have fun here!
