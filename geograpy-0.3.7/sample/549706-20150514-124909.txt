I don't know if its the reader or MC who picks the DPL, but I'm really happy to have you do it, Mim.   

Brace yourself, the next few chapters are so long that one of them may need to split into two files (because it may go longer than an hour.)  

On the newest one, I do apologise: I had my headphone cord draped so that whenever I leaned or moved it added crackle to the recording.  I've cleaned it out as much as I can, but if there are any really bad patches please say so I can re-record them.

I will have a go at book 1 chapter 2 in a few days, but with such long files it takes time to edit them afterward.  Once we get through book I, the chapters become a more reasonable size.
