My $.02 

would be to say "asterisk" where it belongs. It'll sound awkward (and I'd shiver in terror at the thought of me trying to tongue-twist my way through it and the subsequent hair-pulling editing session), but since "asterisk" is how it's referred to earlier in the text "star," etc might be confusinig.

like anyone's going to be able to follow that passage while driving anyway
