ok i tried it out myself and used 24 / 150 / 0,15. it worked fine and i cannot hear a distortion in your voice - at least not from the sample i listened to. what you may have heard was a little leftover of the noise that was audible over your voice. thats not a distortion of your voice, but only a little extra sound. when i listened to it, i thought it sounded fine, especially as the background noise didnt continue through the whole recording, but only a few minutes at a time. just try it out and listen again. as a rule, these things are up to the reader -- if you think the remains of your background noise make your voice sound absolutely terrible, we can stick to the original and leave a little bit of background noise in. but please remember -- you know what to watch out for. try to listen to your own recording as if it was someone elses and you didnt know how it was edited. can you still hear the distortion? in my experience, readers are much stricter when it comes to their own recordings than about other volunteers' CK
