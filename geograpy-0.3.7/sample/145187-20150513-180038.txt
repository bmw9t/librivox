Desired volume range is 87-91. You can try amplifying this recording by 6-7 dB, and check if you can increase your input volume a bit for the future recordings. There's also a slight stumble at around 11:04 "the northern cha-  chain of hills", maybe the stumble can be edited out.Otherwise a very interesting reading! Thank you! I hope the volume can be fixed easily!
