I did a stupid, stupid thing.  I thought I was being clever by copying the password to my hard drive and then deleting the post giving me the password for added security, just in case I should some day leave a window open on a public terminal at my university or something. Unfortunately, I copied it down to my laptop computer only, and not the desktop. Now my laptop is out of commission and I'd like to return to my project that's on hold.So, could someone either send me the existing password or reset the password to the magic window and send the new one, or will I have to get my laptop fixed (something I've been planning on doing anyway)?
