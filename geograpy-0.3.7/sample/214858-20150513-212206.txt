I don't appear to have permission for the MW yet, that being said, on to PL notes!Well, not yet, one more thing to say. I always thought the chapters in Revelation were longer than this. Though to be fair, compared to this commentary I'm currently working on, everything is short.   Also, shamelessly interrupting your solo for advice, should I change the PL to Word Perfect for the Matthew Henry's Commentary? It does have the verses of the Bible with the commentary, so I would assume it could be classified as a Bible.Ok! On to PL Notes!Chapter 1:1:36 for the next 3 or so seconds, there are some odd clicks in the background, loud enough to be heard clearly.2:37 another click, just one this time.3:08 "like one unto..." Should be "one like unto..."Chapter 2:2:35 "...where thou dwelleth" Should be "...where thou dwellest"3:38 "which no man knoweth saveth he that receiveth it." Should be "which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it."4:11 "...because thou suffereth" Should be "...because thou sufferest"Chapter 3:0:25 - 0:31 There is a stumble and repeat for that sentence.2:12 Missing Word "I will make them come..." Should be "I will make them to come..."3:40 "Because thou sayeth..." Should be "Because thou sayest..."3:46 "and knoweth not..." Should be "and knowest not..."3:59 "...and white garment" Should be "...and white raiment"Chapter 4*:2:01 "And when the beasts gave glory..." Should be "And when the beasts give glory..."2:10 "The four and twenty elders fell down..." Should be "The four and twenty elders fall down..."Chapter 5:PL OK!Chapter 6:0:57 "and there were given..." Should be "and there was given..."2:22 "...on them that dwelt" Should be "...on them that dwell"3:43 to end: From 3:43 onwards is the first verse of Chapter 7, so that will need to be removed. I have no idea why they group the verses like that in the text.Chapter 7:0:14 "...standing at the four corners of the earth" Should be "...standing on the four corners of the earth"*There is no past or present in eternity, just the now, the present. Because of this, references to events in eternity are not in past or future tense, only present.The beasts didn't gave glory, they are still giving glory.At least, that's how I understand it.
