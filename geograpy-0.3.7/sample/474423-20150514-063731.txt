Hi Bizmom,I'm sorry that the chapters are a bear to read. Thank you for your interest in the book and for trying to tackle them. I orphaned the chapters. I hope to see you in another project like perhaps The Shaving of Shagpat, The Elements of Botany, Other Things Being Equal, The Fairy Tales of C.P......(a shameless attempt to recruit you, I know. But hey- that's okay, isn't it?  )-Amy
