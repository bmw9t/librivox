Can't wait to hear this when it's all put together <severe note to self: do not delete master .wav files until PL ok>Thank you, this is now PL OK!   (Max, I just quickly checked that one line from your earlier PL note.)I know what you mean - I hate having to download the MP3 file and add to that. The sound is never quite the same. You've done a pretty good patch though!   (If you want to save space on your computer without losing too much information you can export to FLAC files and then delete the master - much easier to adjust those if you need to. I don't actually do this as I tend to keep the master files until the project is catalogued, but I know some people here do it this way.)
