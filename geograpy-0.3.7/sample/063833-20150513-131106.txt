If there's anything you want read that I haven't, just say the word.   Actually, that's how I've usually done it as well. I think our Lady Jane appeared as part of the chorus.Quote:Elizabby, you've been spoiling me; I miss your lovely colour-coded scripts!   Ah, that's the difference between plays and dramatic readings! You'll have to come over and have a look at what I've done with Wives and Daughters! PL Notes for Act 1:@02:45 the word should be "transcendentality" (all the syllables are not quite clear and this is a key concept)Everything else is PL OK, and I agree completely with your choice not to sing the last chorus. "Jane" has a very distinct voice and I don't think she belongs in that part of the finale.
