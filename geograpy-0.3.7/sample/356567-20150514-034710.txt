I do have a question. It may sound a little silly, but please bear with me. My question is this- How do I do a dramatic reading recording? Like I said I haven't done this. Should I leave a space where the other lines should fit? Or just read all the lines back to back? I do each chapter as a seperate recording right?Thanks so much for taking the time to answer my questions. I really appriciate it and I can't wait to get started!Jenn
