I tried to cover all the info in the FAQ.  It's a horror story I love that I'm teaching in a current class.  I'll be posting more as time goes on, and I've volunteered for a chapter in Lucy Clifford.  Nice to know you all.

That's pretty much how it is for everyone (sans proof reader or MC (mediator) ), so it looks like you're good! An MC will pop in at some point in the next day or so to claim your project and give you some more information. If someone is interested they'll ask if they can proof listen as you go, but most of the time projects just get posted here, and those that choose proof-listen to chapters as they go.

Welcome to LibriVox, and it's good to see you're diving right in!
