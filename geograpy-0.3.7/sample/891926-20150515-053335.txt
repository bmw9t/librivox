Yeah, I cringe when I hear many of my early recordings on a crappy mic. But I figure it's not worth taking the time and effort to redo them, and people have been downloading them, so I don't want to get rid of them altogether. I should have gotten a better mic earlier than I did. And actually, I am probably my own worst critic. Yeah, the mic was bad, but I hear others' recordings with similar quality and don't cringe at THEIR recordings...
