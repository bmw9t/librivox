Hello, my name is Tassanee, I am 20, studying "English - International Trade and Politics" in university.I have discovered librivox via the project Gutenberg, I loved the concept, i loved the idea, and as I like reading out loud, one day I would like to help. I am french but i have been learning english since i'm 9 years old. My dream is to become a lawyer in international trade so you should guess that english is one of the languages I cherish mostly.   In Librivox I like "Pride and Prejudice" , "Sense and Sensibility" and all the Austen by the way, I liked "Portrait of a lady' by Henry James, I liked Jane Eyre, Dickens books, and the Art of War, etc.`I can record audiobooks in french and in english, in german too if one day I feel I can do it.   I feel I can volunteer for i've always been a good reader and a good listener. I know how to use audacity for I often record myself to train my english accent which is more of a british one than american one.I hope you accept my account, I agree with the rules, and I salute you,Thank you very much, MERCI BEAUCOUP (i have no imagination ^^ i copied the exact email I sent to the administration of the forum for this introduction, i'm so sorry)
