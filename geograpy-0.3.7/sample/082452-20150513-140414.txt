There must be an app for this    I dunno about the app, I'm a mammoth with a laptop  There are "Listen" links in the MW (Magic Window). Download the tracks to your device and enjoy.  And, of course, there are http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/Main_Page in general and http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/Guide_for_Proof-listeners in particular  And you have my phone # too!
