I hope this is acceptable. This is certainly a poem, but I have no idea what to title it. L. Frank Baum wrote this in a copy of The Road to Oz as an inscription to his little grandson. It's sweet and cute and utterly unknown, but it also has the misfortune of having no title! I creatively (:roll:) called it "Oz story" in naming the file, but if anyone has a better idea, I'd love to hear it. 

Oz Story by L. Frank Baum (1856-1919)
