I guess I can look at that as simply valuable feedback to improve the quality of the reading....but at times it's slightly discouraging.  Maybe I should just aim to look at it as simply good feedback that after I make the edits, the recording will be of more professional quality.  Do all readers get this many pl edits?    okay then.note sure if 52 is mono or not.

What's the best way of determining if a file exported as mono correctly based on file format?  --------------5347:36  http://upload.librivox.org/share/upload ... .mp3couple dozen small pauses removedintro outro silence added. mono.
Thank you, will look shortly
