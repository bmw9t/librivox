I fixed the things that needed fixing in Book III.http://upload.librivox.org/share/uploads/ni/balladofthewhitehorse_03_chesterton.mp316:11I am glad you can enjoy my reading, I hope that whoever they are who download librivox recordings will approve as well. Thank you for taking the time to PL this work. I really do appreciate it.   When I decided to record this work I hadn't heard of it before, and when looking it over I didn't want to read the end in advance. Now I am looking forward to finishing the recording so that I can find out how everything turns out.
