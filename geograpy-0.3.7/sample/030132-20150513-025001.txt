I think it's mostly different readers, Redgrrl ... we all individually choose what we want to work on here, and of course some books are beloved of many different people.  For the listener, it means a choice of voices, which is very cool.  

A few books, it's different versions of the text (Alice in Wonderland has this, for example).  And there probably are some different translations of the same thing available, though I can't think of examples off the top of my head.  Almost all of our catalogue pages link to the online text used in their recording, though, so that might help in making comparisons.

It's a Jane Austen thing mainly  ... I can't think of any author so many of us are so keen to read in collaborations and solos (and it's a terrible shame she's not been better translated, because P&P in French would be the single most awesome thing ever!)

Which books set you to thinking about this question, Redgrrl..?  Maybe I haven't actually answered fully..?
