Miguel/Patti/Lucy: I'm afraid I will not be able to give these files a listen for a while, as I've become embroiled in a monstrous project from work that is consuming pretty much all of my "free" time.  I will try to get you feedback as soon as possible, but it may not be for a while.  Please accept my apologies.

Meanwhile, I've posted the "Listen" links in the database table in the front of this thread in case other LV'ers following this thread want to have a listen.

Cheers,

Ahab
