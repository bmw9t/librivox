Robert,You can go ahead and upload your remaining files to my folder now.  I've moved the first two from the xx folder and put the current links in the magic window (MW) for you.  I'll PM you the login info for the magic window.  Please fill in the remaining titles and links and also add the durations for each file to the notes column.  I'll leave the thread here for a day before moving it to the Going Solo forum or so and to see if someone volunteers to prooflisten for you.  If not, you can post in Listeners Wanted for a PLer.  Please note that I've changed your text link to the google docs page for this book rather than the google play link you had originally.  Lastly, just to reiterate what's been said above, in future, please wait for an MC to pick up your projects before uploading files!   Thanks.
