Don, sorry, that I couldn't reply to you sooner. But I'm glade that you came to a solution based on your own preference. The only thing I would have done differently is to read the section number first because it is the outer numeration and could cause (an initial) confusion between the section as part of the recording series or as part of the book.Greetings Kajo (I value creative name variations of Kajo and 'Kojo' is definitely a good one because I would have some interesting human namesakes, plus a programming language).
