Thanks Judith! Section 1 & 4 have arrived safely.
(it only needs 1 mp3 at the end of course, and you had a space in the link 01 where there shouldn't be one - but I'll fix these file names later)

Unfortunately, section 02 seems to be a truncated upload again....  Is something going wrong? Or have you closed down too early by accident? Could you please try again?

It certainly is worth the trouble of the upload-stress - you have a very beautiful and clear recording voice!
