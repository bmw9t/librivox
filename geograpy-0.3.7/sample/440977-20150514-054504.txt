Thanks so much, Hugh!By previous offer, do you mean PL'ing if I do more books in the series? Don't want to presume what you mean.  I did pull the next one out last night after I finished this one, and I'll probably start it some time soon. I like the fact that if I want something nice and short to record, they fill the bill.
