I too, like reading books over and over again.  I can always remember where I got a particular book, and I often use the receipts as bookmarks.  Now that I have an e-book reader, I have put some of my favourite books on it.  And it has already paid off.  I spend a lot of time taking care of my mother when she need to go to emerg, and it's nice to have an unlimited selection of books at my fingertips.  But even with hundreds of books available, I still find myself returning to my old favourites.
