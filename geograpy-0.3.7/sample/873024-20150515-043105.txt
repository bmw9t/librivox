kieranmullen, I know you are trying to help in the way you know best, but please remember we are all VOLUNTEERS and most of us are just your average run-of-the-mill book lover with little to no previous experiance in this area so we are bound to make mistakes. It just seems a little discouraging to find a post every morning that says we have done something else wrong.
