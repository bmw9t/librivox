Actually, I use MP3Gain to judge the actual perceived dB level, not just Audacity. (If you web search it, you can find it. It doesn't give the volume level on a Mac, though - only on Windows.)  When we catalog projects, we lower or raise the recording's volume as needed to get it to the target 89 dB.I once tried to record a cassette tape into Audacity using the mic plug. It was so loud, it was totally distorted. But ripping audio off a CD and importing it worked VERY well.Actually, Numbers isn't anywhere near completion. Some sections have been claimed, but no recordings have yet been submitted. However, if you want to claim the rest of the sections, it will finish the project off that much quicker - we wouldn't have to wait for the sections to be claimed, although we'll still have to wait for sections to be recorded.
