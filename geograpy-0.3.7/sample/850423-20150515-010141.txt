Praise for martinc (Martin Clifton) via the 'Thank a reader' feature:Quote:Dear Mr. Clifton,I wanted to write a short note of thanks to you for the various readings that you have done over the years. I have listened to all your readings on Librivox, and my personal favorite is your "personal anthology of Shakespeare." I have listened to it countless times, and your voice is my companion on many bike rides. I have sampled nearly all the readers on Librivox, and I must say, at the risk of offending other readers, that yours is by far - in my humble opinion -  the best reading voice among those with a British accent.  The feeling that your voice arouses in the mind is hard to describe, but it is something close to that of Mozart's music. It is melodious, it has the perfect pitch and weight, and it glides over the waves of sentences with the smoothness and command of a cruiser. Dare I say, like Mozart's music, it has an addicting effect upon the listener. Anyhow, many thanks and I hope that you consider attempting more readings in the future. AliAll of Martin's recordings
