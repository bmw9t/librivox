I just listened to your recording, and it was excellent. You have a most adorable voice and accent, it's really pleasing to listen to. 

I would only suggest a couple of little things to improve the recording. 
- There is background noise that could be cleaned. Here is our tutorial: http://librivox.org/wiki/moin.cgi/NoiseCleaning
- please leave 5 seconds of silence at the end. 

Thanks a lot!
