Thanks Will!  I actually check all of the ID3 tags for everyone's recordings before I send them up the line to Annie.  It helps to maintain consistency in them.  I won't be able to hear them until I get home from work - and even at that it'll be a while since like you I'm tied to a modem line.

I've marked it as DONE on the front page and I'll let you know how it went once I give it a listen - probably this evening.  Thanks again!
