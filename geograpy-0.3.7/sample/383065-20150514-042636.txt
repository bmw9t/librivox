Hi Maria,Here's Section 06:http://upload.librivox.org/share/uploads/mb/prayer_06_girardey.mp3 (22:10)Thanks, and have a great weekend! Yes, an early spring here, too. Daffodils have bloomed; daylilies and irises have serious foliage; no Bermudagrass yet, but lots of Po Annua Bluegrass right now. The Rebuds and maples are budding, but the late March frosts we usually get will cause most of them to drop. Bluejays and crows are migrating . . . and coming your way; so, better get your recording done now.  Enjoy the season!
