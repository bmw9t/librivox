Hi Rainer,

I still have the original audacity file for chapter 5, so I removed the repetitive phrase and am resending it to you now.

Regarding chapter 13, I must have had the microphone positioned badly,  because when I started listening to it, there were a lot of small plosives that were very annoying.  I thought it would be easier to record it again than to try to edit them out.  I just reread 13 earlier today and am uploading that as well.

thanks, Judy

p.s. my dad travels to Munich tomorrow.  I am jealous.
