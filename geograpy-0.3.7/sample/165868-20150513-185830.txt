Thank you, Phil! I am so glad you read this. There are so many good things that are "out of bounds" for British readers because of the author's death date, and this is one of them.Just a couple of spots which may benefit from attention:1:44 Text:"Belgium in her poverty today is far greater" I hear "Belgium in her poverty today is far richer"10:55 Text: "revived pagan doctrine" I hear: "received pagan doctrine"Ruth
