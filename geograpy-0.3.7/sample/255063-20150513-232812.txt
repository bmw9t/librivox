First the good news: All of the file names look good and  they all match the required format now.   So that is great.The bad news is that I am withdrawing my offer to DPL this project.  Hope this doesn't cause serious inconvenience.  Thanks for the opportunity to learn more about drama and playwrights and I'm sure this will get cataloged soon.
