Hi everyone! 
I'm looking forward to recording things!  Think I'll start off by doing some chapters of a book, or maybe some poetry if something I like pops up. 
This is a really cool site, I'd never heard about it until I just downloaded Moby Dick.  The guy who recorded that may just have helped me with my exams and he's definitely saved me a load of cash so thanks!
