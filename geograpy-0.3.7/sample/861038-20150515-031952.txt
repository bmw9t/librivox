Oh Ruthie, you are so terribly... realistic...  

I mean, it wouldn't be that bad for them to have a category that includes productions like ours as a sort of 'starter drug', no? And then have people move on to the more...ahem... recent stuff?

And given that they have an extra category for 'Audiobooks in Spanish!!!'... As if that was something we wouldn't do...
