Just a suggestion: I've nearly completed a cover for this one - the Introduction as listed was too long to place on the cover, so I found this one. It's from the advertising pages in the back of the original Henty novels (so it should also be in public domain):

The story begins in a grim feudal castle in Normandie. The times
were troublous, and soon the king compelled Lady Margaret de Villeroy
with her children to go to Paris as hostages. Guy Aylmer went with
her. Paris was turbulent. Soon the guild of the butchers, adopting
white hoods as their uniform, seized the city, and besieged the house
where our hero and his charges lived. After desperate fighting, the
white hoods were beaten and our hero and his charges escaped from
the city, and from France.
