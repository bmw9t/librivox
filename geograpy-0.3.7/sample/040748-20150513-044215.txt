Sam -- I have one more chapter of Dracula pending -- ch. 24.  I will donate it it you if you'd like it!  I have _plenty_ on my plate to keep me busy, heheh.  Just let Paula know if you'd like to read it.

If you're having trouble with recording quality, you could upload a small sample for us to hear.  Someone can probably steer you in the right direction.
