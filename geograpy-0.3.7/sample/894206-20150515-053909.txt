I've used the BookDesign one.  tbook is a member here and actively solicited feedback on the previous few iterations (and then took it on board and used much of it!  )  It can be a bit idiosyncratic about whether it bookmarks or not, but I've not picked up enough of a pattern to see if it's a bug or I'm simply doing the wrong thing with it.  But so much fun to browse our catalogue that way!I was previously using MortPlayer which needed books to be downloaded.  And there was one before that ... I don't remember the name, but they stopped updating and so it didn't connect to the catalogue any more.
