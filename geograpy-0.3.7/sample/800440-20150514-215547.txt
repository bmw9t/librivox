I think that removing the intros/outros is a valid argument for keeping the 2nd version, but how to note it in the wiki may be a problem. "64kbps, intros/outros removed" is too wordy. I don't think a different cover is enough of a change to warrant a whole new M4B offering.It's a toss-up for me. Not that we're taking a vote on this or anything.
