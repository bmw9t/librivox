JMPSection 25:   Nicely done , just a few minor fixes needed.Volume on the low side at 82 dBs, suggest you amplify by 6.0 to reach target of 89 dBs.  (no clipping noted with amplification) Ending silence only 2 seconds, needs 3 seconds of silence added to the end for the recommended 5 seconds total. As you will need to re-upload anyway, could you check the ID3 tags and make changes as follows: ID3 tag Track title missing number  should read "25 - A Winter Fancy", Album Title should read "Wit and Humor of America Volume 7"  This will save Linny from having to correct it later  Thank you,Joyce
