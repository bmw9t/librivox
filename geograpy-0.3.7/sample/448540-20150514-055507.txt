Lea also has a three volume History of the Inquisition of the Middle Ages, of which I have read the first volume and do not consider as interesting.  He also has scads more books dealing with all sorts of medieval church minutiae (Two volumes of History of Sacerdotal Celibacy in the Christian Church anybody?)http://www.archive.org/details/historysacerdot01leagoog
