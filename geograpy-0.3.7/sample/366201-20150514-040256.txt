Have fun with the book!Edit: I changed the file name, got rid of the blank space and hopefully the link now works... Wow!  This is  wonderful.  I'll jot down a phonetic for each one while I listen to your pronunciations.  I had used only Mandarin phonetics found on-line and some are definitely not anything like you are pronouncing.  I'm so glad you were able to take the time to help me - and even what each means AND also the characters.  Wish me luck now trying my meager attempt at these - Thanks so much!
