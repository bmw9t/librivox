But when I was trying to export to mp3 format, I got a message saying I needed "/lame" to do so, and then when I clicked the link for the download I got a "Forbidden" error message. Any suggestions? (I've got Audacity 1.3.5 Beta on this computer and this is the first time I've tried to make an mp3 with it.)

Here is the link for Lame:

You need to unzip it and tell audacity where to find it.
