Katdad,I hope this is not too far O/T. Feel free to delete if not.I've not got a great background in History, frankly, at scule, it bored the socks off me. If only I had been given Macaulay to read, his sublime bitchiness would have lightened up the gloom:)A while back, I followed the BBC audible, "This Sceptred Isle." I thought then it was the finished article, our history, wrapped up and sorted.It ain't. most of it seems, er, "sampled," from Winston Churchill's, "History of the English Speaking Peoples." It refers to the reign of William Of Orange with insouciant respect and scanty detail, compared to the fizzing political cauldron that was Macaulay's version, I was surprised. Same with Elizabeth 1. I thought those two were important and reigned at hugely influential times.This history by Hume is detailed and interesting by comparison with, "Sceptred Isle." (Wot I've read so far:)If anyone wants to catch TSI, it is currently running around William's time, and is available in a daily segment of 15 minutes.http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b009t23kbrendan
