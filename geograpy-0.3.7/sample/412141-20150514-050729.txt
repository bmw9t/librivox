Thanks, Hugh. I'll update the tags. I went with "Chapter" for the intro's, but I'm rethinking that as I move through the text. I will change this to "Letter" (I'll change the recording and the tags).I'll get some additional letters up for you this weekend, then I'll be in the woods for a few weeks, so don't expect more until late September.
