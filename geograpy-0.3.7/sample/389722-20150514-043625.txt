Hey everyone:I've just orphaned a few small roles, leaving 17 roles total that are now open. This project has been moving pretty slowly, so I'd like to invite folks to feel free to claim multiple roles if you've already read one, just as long as the characters are not in the same scene. Help me get this one moving again!
