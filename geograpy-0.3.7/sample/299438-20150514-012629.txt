Quote:Hi Kevin,It's Librivox policy to read the text as is without adding anything to it, so even though it's in the original, I don't think it's permissible to veer off this particular translation. The first two notes I made pertain to the names. You may want to wait before making any changes to the notes I've made until Ann sees this so she can correct me if I'm wrong.I am going to have to second what Laura has said here.  We need to stick to the text as it is written, not the way it probably should be.  The PG version is the PD version that we have to stick to, if we deviate from that, we could walk into a sticky area.  If the full Russian name is not there, then it needs to be read that way.
