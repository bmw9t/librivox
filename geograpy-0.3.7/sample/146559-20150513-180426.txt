I am trying this approach that I hope will allow listeners to move from story to story more easily.  It should work OK.  The actual section number is in the file name and they will line up perfectly when cataloging.  In any case I will check the first post to see if it should be re written.EDIT:  I should have said that if you find this an uncomfortable approach while listening, or if you think it doesn't work, please let me know. I can easily change the intros.
