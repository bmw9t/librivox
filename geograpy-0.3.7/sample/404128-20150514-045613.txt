Good afternoon on a slightly crisp and sunny autumn day. I hear there is actually snow up north!  (crisp in Florida is a wondrous thing, let me say!) Hope all is well in your worlds, Elli and Ruth!Here is Chapter nine - which leaves much room for guessing about chapter ten. http://upload.librivox.org/share/uploads/rg/dragonofwantley_09_wister.mp3I guess I am feeling just the slightest bit giddy, being one chapter closer to done.  All the best, and thanks for all that you do!Dolly
