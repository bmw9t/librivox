And this is part of why the podcasts faded out, it's quite hard to get lots of people sending in bits and pieces even on an ad hoc basis, let alone enough for a weekly show.  And it's possible to do a show more or less solo, Jim did some great ones, but then it's even more work in pulling together ideas!!    However, here are some things that used to work for me:Pose a cliffhanger request!  "Do you have 5 minutes for a secret recording mission?  PM me for more info!"  After all, we're recording audiobooks, not sharing bank details ... there's very risk here.  And people can always say no once they find out what you're up to.  Recruiting by PM also has the advantage that you can vary what you're asking for each time, so you don't end up with 10 people all saying "drink a glass of water before you start." Make a same-day request!  20th Sept is ages away.  Sounds good, I'll definitely do it in a week.  Or maybe the day before.  Oh, look, the dog ate my homework.    Same-day, especially at the weekend, is easier -- either people can or they can't.Research!  We've discussed this a few times before.  You could put together a 'highlights' script and ask for a volunteer to record that.  It's very often easier to find someone to read something pre-written than having to come up with it themselves.  (Certainly that's how it is for me.)Demonstrate!  I *love* before and after examples.  And I've long been trying to work out whether the difference when I warm up, clean my teeth, drink water, etc. is in confidence and tone, or actually affects vocal quality.  Over 7 years, I've not come to a firm conclusion.  Too many variables.  But, experiments are always fascinating listening.
