Well, 
I have been thinking of taking a look, at least, at the Alaskan. I'm discussing it with myself at the moment.

I haven't seen it as a hard work reading about Jimmie Dale. On the contrary it has been great fun, and as long as my voice holds I enjoy this very much. The thing that takes time is the checking and editing.

During my radioyears we started a special tape where we put all the things we edited out, all hummings, alls coughs, mistakes, silly laughs, breakdowns in interviews or whatever it could be that was wrong. It did grew to be quite a large tape after a time, and we used to listen to it now and then when we wanted some good laughs. We even considered doing a radiospecial out of it. But, no, we never did.

Have a nice time
