HelloBelow is the link to section 04, Mummery by Thomas Beer (length: 38:37). There is a problem with the recording, though, but I didn't know how to fix it and wondered if you could help me figure out what the problem is. In several spots, the audio is chopped for a fraction of a second and it ends up cutting out a syllable or two of a word. An example of this is around 38:08 during the sentence "Lay down, Mamma." This occurs about 25 times during the entire recording. What can I do to fix this?https://librivox.org/uploads/philchenevert/ohenryprizestoriesof1921_04_various.mp3
