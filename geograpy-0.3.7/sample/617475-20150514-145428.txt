Hi Rachel! 

 Welcome to LibriVox and welcome to The Melting of Molly!  Sections 3 and 4 are all yours!  I'm totally excited too, to think this little book's going to be your first project!
 Since this is your first recording, could you please submit a test recording? Nothing much, just one or two minutes - that would help us check all the tech specs and other simple things. And then you'll be good to go. You could upload it to tests-tests folder on the uploader. If you need anything, just ask! 
 And one more thing - what would you like to have for your Catalog name? It could be your real name or forum name or just about anything you wish for - that's the name which will appear on the LibriVox Catalog. If you've got a URL we could link to, we could do that too! 

Quote:Incidentally, why are the chapters called 'leaves'? Does anyone know?

I've got absolutely no idea; I've been wondering the same thing. Perhaps when you all read the story, you'll know. And you could tell me! 

By the way, how did you arrive at the forum name skyscrapersandwiches? 

Happy recording! Have fun, Rachel!
