Sorry for the slow response!  I think I had notifications turned off.  The website that catrose mentioned would be the best way to access the app on a computer.  It doesn't have all of the functionality of the app, but it does use the same database, so everything is there.  (If anyone is interested, the results are sorted based on their popularity in the app, so you can see what people are listening to there.)  Hope that helps!
