Hi Matthew - by "Superflous text"  what exactly do you mean ?  If it is part of Jane Austen words  no - every word is sacred. But if it's bits we add like "End of Chapter one 10sec silence start of chapter 2"  these are not necessary in a single file,  in other words bits we have added to the text files  , that is fine. PM me or Jonathan if you need claification 
Keep up the good work.
