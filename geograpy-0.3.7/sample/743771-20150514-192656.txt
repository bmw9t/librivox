Thanks!  I'm not normally careless in editing, but I was experiencing virus-like behavior on my PC and actually broke my editing by about 3 hours to do a full hard-drive scan.  Those problems are right about in the seam between the sessions.  Guess I didn't resume at the right place.   I'll take care of it! 8)
