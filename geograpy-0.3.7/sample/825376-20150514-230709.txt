Yes, you're right, Phil, I meant the mic.   No, I have the setting on the Cardioid setting.I'm beginning to think that most of my noiseis coming from my Dell PC.  USB is supposed totake care of most of that but I've got my Yetisheltered in it's box now with foam padding.(You should see this get-up!) I'm still getting white noise or ambient noise (not sure what thedifference is) but I did just run a short file andwas able to clean it on a pretty highsetting without distorting my voice.I'm going to keep working with this.  It's drivingme crazy because even if I move the mic as farfrom the computer as possible, I can't controlnoise that may be coming through the connectionto the computer.Sign me, frustrated.Lee Ann
