LOVE the accent Laura! I could understand you quite well. There are a few small technical pointers I can make-

There were some plosives (air breaths on the mic) and the volume was slightyly low on my playback. I would recomend two things:

 1. Either move the mic further away or if its a headset, set it away from direct breathing ie above the nose or below the chin.

2. turn up the input volume on the mic (done within the recording prgram)

Otherwise, it was a lovely reading!
