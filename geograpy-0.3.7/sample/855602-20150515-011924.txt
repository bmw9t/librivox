Oxenhandler wrote:@ link removed by admin Yes, this recording (of a work I've read, and yes, not particularly enjoyed) exists through the generosity of several volunteers, each of whom have contributed hours of hard work.  But what if I should listen and not enjoy it, for reasons technical or otherwise?  Why, I'll have lost nearly minutes of my life!  Frankly, I'd write and complain!  Or, you know, I could sign up and record a version of it myself, or facilitate the reading thereof by others.  But why bother, right?  I'll never get those minutes back.
