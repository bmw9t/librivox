Hi Anthony

I'd say the type of mic depends on your budget. You can get something decent with a headset, with a USB plug is the best, but a standing microphone will save you a lot of editing work (believe me, I know ). Some people, like Esther, use a portable digital recorder. the last 2 options are generally more expensive than the headsets, so really it depends on what you want to achieve and what you are willing to spend. I started with a headset, until I finally stopped being in denial and admitted to myself that I was hooked  , then I got a standing one and have not regretted it.
You can have a look here for suggestions.
