Hey - hey! Stop dissing one of my favourite teenage junk foods! ;) I actually like carby staples together. Even the Italians (very civilised in terms of food, you will agree) do it on occasion - there's a dish from the mountain region that puts pieces of potato in the pasta sauce. Forget what it's called, but it's great. Very wintery.
Spaghetti on toast... well... it's not that different from beans on toast. You do have beans on toast?!
