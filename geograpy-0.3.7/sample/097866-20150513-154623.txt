Hi Maria,Your MW is ready, and yes, I will DPL this fun one!I think it might be better to use Various as author on this one.  The links for your sources will be entered into each section, then we can credit the author as the SF Call there, since there are no by-lines.  I will have to ponder this one for a little bit to see if I am happy with using Various though, I am starting to have my doubts on that one because we can just as easily use SF Call as the author instead of Various.    We can think on the title for a little bit, before you start recording.  If we need to tweak it, we can, but I think so far the working title is fine.  I definitely defines what you are reading, which is important.  I think that the title that you have now is very newspaper-y (I think I invented a new word!).  Reading selected articles related to the earthquake and fire only is fine, and reading the long list of names will be a bit much.  If someone really wanted to know the names, they can go to the articles themselves.  But, I think the people (i.e. genealogists) who what that information have already done that.  I will come back a little later and let you know the result of my ponderings.  I know you are a unsure of how the template came out, I think that the project looks fine so far!
