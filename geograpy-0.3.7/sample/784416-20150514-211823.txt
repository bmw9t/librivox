Helloooooo, actors,

I have finished stringing together the lines for act 3 and find that I am missing just a few things, to wit:

Jack: I don't think that, as things are now, it would be of much practical use to either of us, Dr. Chasuble.

Jack: Miss Prism, Lady Bracknell, has been for the last three years Miss Cardew's esteemed governess and valued companion.

Gwendolyn: If you are not too long, I will wait here for you all my life.

Narrator: Rushes to bookcase and tears the books out.

So, this is John, Deana, and Betsie. When I get these lines, I can finish and we can start the proof listening and final adjustments.

This play is so funny, and you guys did such a beautiful job with it! Kudos!

Paula
