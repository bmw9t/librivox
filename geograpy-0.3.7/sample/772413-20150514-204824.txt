Well, oh well, I was thinking of volunteering for this one but don't think the law allows me to (why on earth did I go looking for a French version of this book!! I would have never known!)  .

Maurice Leblanc passed away in 1941, so, I'd have to wait for 5 more years before I could volunteer. 
Unless ... this might only be true for books published in my beautiful country ... Hmm  ... No, it's probably true for all the ones published in the European union.  

So, unless I cross the Atlantic to record, no chance for me to do this. And since I don't plan to cross it any time soon...
