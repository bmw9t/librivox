This one was mentioned in the introduction on PBS of Christie's "Cards on the Table":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_Murder_case#Quote:The Bridge Murder case, also known as the Bridge Table Murder case was the trial of Myrtle Adkins Bennett, born on March 20, 1895, in Tillar, Arkansas, a Kansas City housewife, for the murder of her husband John G. Bennett over a game of contract bridge in September 1929.Quote:On March 6, after eight hours of deliberations, the jury's verdict was that Myrtle Bennett was not guilty of murder. Reed (defense attorney) wondered only why jurors took so long. Page's (prosecutor) assistant, John Hill, said, “It looks like an open season on husbands.”
