8)  Today I downloaded my first book from Librivox. Took a long time. The computer kept saying the downloading went with 222 kB per second. As far as I know my modem should be able to work faster. "115200" it says... Isn't that faster? Or is it talking bytes?    I know I'm a bit of a computer dummy, but can anybody give me some advice here?
Thanks ye brainy guys and dolls!
