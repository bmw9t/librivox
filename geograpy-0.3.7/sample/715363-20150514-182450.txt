Id say cinque should have one syllable.  Its French for five, isn't it?   I've heard that kind of cinque actually sound like "sank" as in "sink, sank, sunk"! but that's the French nasal vowel sound.

I'm just going to say that we can't really enforce unity on pronounciation, and anyway, LibriVox policy is "Do the best you can, but sound confident."  So, although it's good to make the effort, please don't let this hold you up too long.
