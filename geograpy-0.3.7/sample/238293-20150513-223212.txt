If you are willing and have the time, would you be able to fill out this cast list code generator: http://ia600309.us.archive.org/0/items/LibrivoxM4bCollectionAudiobooks/CastCoder.html   You can either just copy the code into a post or PM it to me. It would be a big help if you could do it, but if you don't have time, that is fine, just let me know.Thanks!Yes, I can do that I think! Do you want me to put if they read for the "gardener" or "all" aside from the main role? I didn't do that in the cast list because I thought it was too much info on the tiny little parts people helped to do.So can we mark the cast list in the MW PL OK?
