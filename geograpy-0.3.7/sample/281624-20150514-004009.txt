By the way, David, I used Stephan's out-of-tune piano intro as part of my recording of Section 11, at the very beginning and at the end of the section.

I'm assuming Stephan has released his piano recording for PD use ... sorry, if this introduces a complication.  I really think the piano bit helps the whole thing sound more professional.

Give a listen to any of the chapters for Slocum's _Sailing Alone_ (an excellent recording).  Here the reader used PD seagulls to great effect.
