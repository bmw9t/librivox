All audio files can be found on our catalog page: https://librivox.org/american-men-of-mind-by-burton-e-stevenson/ Quote: “American Men of Mind” is a collection of short biographies of men of note in various disciplines. It is an absorbing collection of short biographies of men who made a difference in American history;  most beginning life in very humble circumstances,  both in the United States and in foreign countries.  Although “men” is mentioned in the title,  Mr. Stevenson also relates biographies of several women.This is a most interest read.William Tomcho  Text source (only read from this text!):  http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24200  Type of proof-listening required (Note: please read the PL FAQ):  standard Laura Victoria will be the dedicated PL  IMPORTANT - soloist, please note: in order to limit the amount of languishing projects (and hence the amount of files on our hard-pressed server), we ask that you post an update at least once a month in your project thread, even if you haven't managed to record anything. If we don't hear from you for three months, your project may be opened up to a group project if a Book Coordinator is found. Files you have completed will be used in this project. If you haven't recorded anything yet, your project will be removed from the forum (contact any admin to see if it can be re-instated).Please don't download or listen to files belonging to projects in process (unless you are the BC or PL). Our servers are not set up to handle the greater volume of traffic. Please wait until the project has been completed. Thanks!Magic Window:
