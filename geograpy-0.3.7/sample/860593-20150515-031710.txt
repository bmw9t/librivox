After some thought and discussion with David (earthcalling - he of the original Fav Chapters collections) I have--maybe--the germ of a workable idea.

Rather than a "best-of collection", which would result in repeated entries in the catalog, a simple list in one of the forums would meet the goal of recognizing exceptional content without the nasty criticism or catalog redundancy problems. 

Perhaps a sticky or rolling entry in the 'Suggestions, Comments, News & Discussion' or 'Volunteers Wanted: Other Projects' areas with regularly (or semi-regularly) updated lists such as "Picks of the Week," "All-Time Favorites," "Favorite Chapters," "Favorite Poems," "Favorite Shorts," et cetera... 

I'd be happy to take the lead on tallying and posting the results. I'd appreciate suggestion on how best (or if, indeed) to proceed from the wiser heads here assembled.
