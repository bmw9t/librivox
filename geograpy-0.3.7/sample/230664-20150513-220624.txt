Hi - I see in the Magic Window in big red font that there are edits needed for Chapter 21 but I've tried to find the unread PL notes and haven't been successful. We had some back and forths about the new uploader rules (not applicable to this project), tags and end silence lengths but those were corrected and I reposted the revised version (i thought).Please help me out here because that red font is definitely alarming/depressing    ThanksJude Somers
