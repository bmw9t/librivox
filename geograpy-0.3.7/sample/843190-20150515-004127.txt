Send a PM to fae!  She'll be delighted you're interested.Second, there's some Spanish language books over at Project Gutenberg: http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/languages/eselsilla wrote:* I have a few stories translated to Spanish from Oscar Wilde and others which are currently in public domain. Can I record these without getting into trouble?You'll have to specifically dedicate those translations to the public domain; I'll let others who know how to do that point you in the right direction.  (I'm assuming you DID do the translations yourself, and that the original stories are public domain; I think most everything of Oscar Wilde's is, but do double-check.)elsilla wrote:Moms of disabled children are also willing to volunteer recording for this project.

Drag 'em in, by all means!
