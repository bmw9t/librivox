Kri, you just blew my mind. The Crappy Press has vanity fees now? Ew. I just threw up in my mouth a little.

Of course, Zazzle has no fees! They earn their money by their own cut of royalties, like any legit business.

And yes, Zazzle does shirt backs. Like with cards, you can do the backs if you wish. So my design has a front and a back.
