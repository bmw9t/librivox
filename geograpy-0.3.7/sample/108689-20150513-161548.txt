Welcome Jim, I see you've solve your test recording problems.   To remove the unwanted clicks, simply highlight them in Audacity and cut / delete them out (you will then have the 1/2 to 1 second of opening silence)    You also have 13 seconds of ending silence, could you cut that down to the required 5 seconds please. I couldn't help but notice that you've read the standard LibriVox intro & disclaimer; for the Weekly Poetry all we need is the intro in the opening post.
