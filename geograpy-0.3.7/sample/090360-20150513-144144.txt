Hello! Welcome here!You have a nice setup, tech spec are correct! The volume is a bit low, too soft. Check if you can increase the input volume of your microphone, either from Audacity's microphone slider in Mixer Toolbar, or from your system's control panel for sound and microphones. Alternatively, we could use the Amplifying Effect in Audacity, but it's better if we record within the desired range in the first place. At this volume level, there's no background noise, but we might get some with increased (or amplified) volume. So once we get the volume right, we'll work on the background noise if needed.If you use Audacity, you can estimate a nice volume with this visual hint, when the waveform peaks above the 0.5 mark:or, you could use a little program called the Checker for a more presice measurement in numbers. Desired range is about 87-92dB (89dB being ideal). Your current file is about 81dB.Please ask if there are any questions, or upload a new file when you've adjusted the volume. Post in this same thread when ready, and we'll then check the background noise.
