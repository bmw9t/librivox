Hi, GailJust answering your question, when a section has mistakes that require re-recording and the reader isn't available to fix them, the BC can just re-open the section for a new reader. Some people don't like to do that, and prefer to try and find someone with a similar voice to record the missing bits or something, others think it's less work to just ave another reader. That depends on the BC.
