Afraid this isn't as campy as it might've been by my standards, only because attempts at Camp give me a big case of the heebs, leading to identity crises where I'm certain that I'm nothing more than A Ham.

Caveats aside, if you need me to re-record any or all, ping me this week as I'll have time and be proximal to equipment et cet.

Can't wait to hear it all strung together.
