I am just wondering how I would record the Prologue in a book and then keep the Chapter numbers right in a book.  Example: If I use 001 for the Prologue then 002 will be Chapter 1.Does this sound right or is there some other way such as just use the Chapter Titles.That way it would be002- Chapter 1 Juorney to the middle (or something like that)I hope this makes sense.Ken  ( I am thinking about doing At the Earth's Core by Edgar Rice Burroughs)
