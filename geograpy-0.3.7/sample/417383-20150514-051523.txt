I meant actually including the midi file with ours, and I meant recording our own midi files--therefore no copyright problem.  They are very easy to do, I believe.  You need a good pianist who will play the music accurately into the computer.  My husband said he would be willing (if one of his college students helps him get the technology right).  We'd have to figure out how to put each separate midi file in, but with our access to all the music students--he teaches at Baylor U School of Music--I'm sure we could get the help.  The thing is--that's a lot of songs. If there's someone else out there profficient in the piano, it'd be terrific to get help!  If there's not enough people here, I could probably find some of friends and tug on their arms to help!
