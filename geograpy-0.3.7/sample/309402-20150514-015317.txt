I'm up for any of those, indeed! Clarissa has left us on a cliffhanger, Culture and Anarchy I didn't know the title but looked it up and was *really* drawn to it, and winter is always appropriate for some Dostoyevsky   I offered a cd cover for Clarissa to be added in the page. I hope you'll like it!
