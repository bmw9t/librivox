Phil,  I love, love, love your videos. I never notice things like "lip smacks" unless you point them out.  To me they sound personable and friendly.  These videos are a great blessing to me because, while I could (and have tried on occasion) to read through the detail where it is written, my eyes have trouble reading long texts, especially on the computer.  I've done very basic PLing for a bit and am anxious to take it to the next level.  Your PL videos are a real boon to me because, before I discovered them, I was anticipating several more hours of searching out, cutting, pasting and printing the information I need so I'd be able to read and absorb it.   You're giving me a chance to move forward much more easily!!I do have a question on Proof Listening 103.  Is  the information about ID3 tags and file names current.  The reason I asked is I stumbled on a couple things like that and reported them to my BC and there seems to be some confusion as to what I need to report and what the new system will take care of on its own.  Do you know those details? Once again THANK YOU for doing these videos!    -Joy  (okay so SOMEDAY I'll work up a signature line.   )
