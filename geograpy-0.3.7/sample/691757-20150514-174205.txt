Got it, Ralph, I'll spot-listen to it tonight when I get home.

Hey, no need to be sorry...if readers never made mistakes, there would be no need for proof-listeners (and I'd have probably never joined as a forum member)! I've seen error reports where a chapter actuallymade it into the catalog that was a repeat of an earlier chapter. The intro said it was Chapter XX, but the reading was actually of Chapter SS. This is just a tiny blip compared to something like that. That's why I recommend readers keep the project files or a wav file of both the  "raw" recording and of the edited result as long as possible.
