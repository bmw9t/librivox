Chuck,Put this out to the world.  Share it.  No one is ever completely happy with the way they sound.  Apply our "no audition" policy to your own part - it is what you could do on that day.  People will be listening to the entire ensemble of voices and the author's story which they tell!  You picked the story for us to tell for good reasons, now don't hoard it!Todd
