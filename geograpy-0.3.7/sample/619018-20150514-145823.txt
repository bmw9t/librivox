Hi Illiterati -

I've uploaded Section 00 (Author's preface and introduction).

Link - http://upload.librivox.org/share/upload ... 0_zola.mp3

File duration - 25 mins 21 secs

Note for PL: The given text contains a couple of typo's - e.g. "thinly" for "thinks" in para 3 of the Notes and elsewhere some missing punctuation.  I have checked the text against the Gutenberg file of the original Italian - E de Amicis "Ricordi di Parigi", Emile Zola chapter.

If you like the reading, could you please allot me Chapter 3 (Sections 9 - 13).

Best wishes
Martin
