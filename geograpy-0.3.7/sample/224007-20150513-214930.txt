1 - The Happy Prince - there is a mistake in the Google Doc. The Swallows' line where they comment on the Swallow's courtship of the Reed on p2 should be:Quote:"It is a ridiculous attachment," [twittered the other Swallows] "she has no money, and far too many relations." [and indeed the river was quite full of Reeds].In the context of the performances recorded I think it would not sound consistent if the words were edited into the right order, so I wonder if the readers would re-do this line so that the phrasing will be right.  I've referred to this where appropriate in the PL notes below.
