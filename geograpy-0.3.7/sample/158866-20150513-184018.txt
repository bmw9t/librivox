Good reading absolutely needs some character speech in my opinion!! Use all the poetic licence and interpretative skills you have. You mean you uploaded version 3 of section 2 again?  The normal procedure is to finish editing before uploading; I put it into the magic window for proof listening;  and then the proof listener listens and reports if there is anything to fix or change.   At that point the recorder makes changes (if necessary) and uploads again.   This keeps the proof listener from having to check a file multiple times if the reader keeps uploading corrected versions.   Does this make sense? I am not awake yet so itmay be garbled.  anyway, let me know.   laissez le bon temp rouler!! Let the Good Times Roll and Happy Mardi Gras everyone
