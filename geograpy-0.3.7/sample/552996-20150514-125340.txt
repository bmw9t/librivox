Oh, I wouldn't bother to redo. But I'm lazy that way.  I'm listening to Ch1 now and enjoying it so much, even with the distortion.  I love hearing your proper accents. I did a solo recording of More William myself and had a great time with it, but now our listeners can choose to hear a real British William! :)

I'm so cross that none of the other William books are PD.
