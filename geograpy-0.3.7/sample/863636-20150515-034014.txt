I was looking at the science fiction short story forum and I saw works by Philip K. Dick, Harry Harrison and Kurt Vonnegut. I may be confused, but I don't think those works should be in the public domain. Could someone please explain to me either why I'm wrong or why we are otherwise allowed to record them?
