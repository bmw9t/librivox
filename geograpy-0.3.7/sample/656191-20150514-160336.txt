Hello Mark! 
Primarely I want to thank you for this wonderful recording! Great job! 

But I also have a question for those acquainted with English customs. When Pip leaves Joe for the city, Joe and Biddy throw shoes, obviously to wish luck or something like that. Well, after a memorable press conference in Bagdad, throwing shoes is not necessarily associated with positive feelings...
Can anyone shed light on this?

Greetings and thanks again, Mark!
