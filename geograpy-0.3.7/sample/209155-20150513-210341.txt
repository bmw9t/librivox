Yes, Spenser seems always to arrange the word in the line so that it comes out "meLANchoLY."  Shakespeare and Milton seem to say "REcepTAcle."  These are atrocious-sounding, of course, but hey, the verse structure depends on the stress patterns the authors used.  Same with rhyme.  "Said" no longer rhymes with "maid," but it did then, so that's how I read itâ€”when it matters to the rhyme, and when I'm on my best behavior.  Thanks for noticing.It's only within the last hundred years that "the wind" came to rhyme with "rescind" rather than with "bind."  But "to wind," meaning to blow into, is seldom used and therefore has not changed yet.  As a result, kids wonder what perversity of language makes a writer refer to how Roland "winds his horn."  You wind a watch, not a horn.BTW, I've noticed that throughout the entire English-speaking world, nearly all noun-verb pairs like "a TORment" vs. "to torMENT" are collapsing, nearly always with the noun form taking over for both parts of speech.  A whole generation is growing up who have never heard the verb "to proTEST."  Soon we'll hear on the stage, "The LAdy DOTH PRO test too MUCH, meTHINKS."  Goodbye, iambic pentameter.Tom
