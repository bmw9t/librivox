Hi All,Just completed a listening session on "Before you press record" Parts 1&2.Really helpful stuff. Previously I had looked at the recording process as simply that; just a recording. I had never considered it in full process context. The listening session revealed to me so many useful secrets inherent, but not obvious, within the recording process. So, many thanks to all the generous contributors in the BYPR Parts 1&2 mini series. The 150% text display was a good tip, as was highlighting and time stamping difficult passages for later easier retrieval. Displaying text in hard copy and in landscape seemed a useful method of prepping and the guideline of 3 to 4 pages of reading as 20 to 24 minute duration was also useful. The English pronunciation site: howjsay.com seem like a really good resource as also does the recommended: McMillan on-line dictionary. So, all-in-all great stuff.Thanks again folks   Regards -Frank
