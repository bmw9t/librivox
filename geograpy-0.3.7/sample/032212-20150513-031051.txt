Aww, thanks for the warm welcome. It's much appreciated.

I do have a question, actually. Your forums are impressively big. I was wondering where you would suggest I start wandering if I'm interested in doing some recording. I don't want to post where I shouldn't, being a silly little newbie and all.

As far as Lupin's patronus, that was never revealed. I simply wanted Lupin's name in my e-mail when I created it oh-so-long ago, and I just attached the word "patronus" to it 'cause I figured it was one of the most important things associated with him in the series... next to being a werewolf and all...

Again, thanks for being so kind and welcoming. I'm excited to get started on doing... something for you guys!
