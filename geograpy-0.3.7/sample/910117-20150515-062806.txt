For example (gained over the last twenty years or so from sundry Church committees)The matter was discussed. = Somebody said something.After a full discussion =  Several people said something and even held opinions.After a vigorous discussion = Not only did everybody put their oar in and hold opinions, they disagreed, but the proprieties were observed.After a frank discussion = There was little agreement, several people went red in the face and some were incoherent with rage. After a full and frank discussion =  Everybody disagreed with everybody else, personal insults were exchanged, the morals of the vicar and his wife were impugned.After robust discussion = Sides were taken, people came to blows.After heated discussion = Similar to robust discussion but the police had to be called to restore order.
