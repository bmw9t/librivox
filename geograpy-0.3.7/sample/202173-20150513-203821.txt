Thanks KayTee The volume is indeed a bit low, it's 84 dB when we need 89. That is because you have some high peaks that prevent amplifying. A workaround is to go to >Effects>Leveller and use moderate or heavy. That evens out the waves, and then you can amplify a bit more.You also have quite a bit of background noise. If you go to >Effects>High pass filter and choose the settings Rolloff: 12Filter quality: the default valueCutoff frequency: 200it helps a lot.One last thing: you have 2 seconds of silence at the beginning, it should be reduced to 0.5 to 1 second.I'll leave the rest of the PL to our DPL
