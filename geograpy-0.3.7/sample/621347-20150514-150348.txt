I'm pretty sure that in England too in the early part of the twentieth century it had the same less specific meaning that you suggest.

Curiously to "press one's suit" has gone the other way, and now means apply a large steam iron to articles of formal clothing rather than approach a prospective partner with a marriage proposal.

Hey ho.
