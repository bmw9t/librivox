Hello kittenmittens, Â welcome to Librivox. I hope you will enjoy here. That's no problem, we are a very friendly comunity- and there are some very helpful people who will be more than happy to answer every question that you might have. I advise you to start by reading a little from the librivox wiki, and uploading a one-minute sampal recording, just to make sure that your tecnical settings are all correct. I'll be sure to listen to your sampal recording and give feedback.      Stav.
