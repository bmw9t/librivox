Since I went ahead and recorded and partially edited it, may I also read section 08 - The Mons Road.

A little note for other readers, apparently the text was processed by my cousine OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and wherever it saw the letter 'l' both upper and lower case it seems to have mis-rendered it as capital 'I", for example: Scheldt appears as SheIdt.  It took me a while to realize that Ie and Ies were not some idiomatic French words that I was unfamiliar with, but rather the articles Le and Les such as: Les braves Canadiens.
