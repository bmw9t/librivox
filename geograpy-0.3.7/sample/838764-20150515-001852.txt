Quite a few of us record on v1.2.6, then export as a wav file, and noise-clean that in 1.3.3 before exporting to mp3 and uploading.
I have been using it for editing but not recording, as I record directly onto an Archos Gmini 402. I've had a few crashes, but not many, and I have learnt the save-play keystroke combination (ctrl-s, space) which generally gets me out of all sorts of trouble. And it seems to reduce the crash-rate too
