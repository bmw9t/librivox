When your ready will be fine take your time, this collection is just starting so there's plenty of time. (one collection starts as one finishes).
Read the first post in this thread and you will find everything there, if there is something your not sure of don't hesitate to give me a yodel.
And a big welcome, good luck with your first recording.

Thanks Lucy
