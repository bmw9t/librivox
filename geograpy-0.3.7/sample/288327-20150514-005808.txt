Your voice is fabulous and your recording is just wonderful.  I am marking your recording as PL OK (proof listened OK) and will request that you record more things for LibriVox right away.   Gee, where have you been hiding?    No doubt your 1 minute test will be approved with no problems. Try the REaders WAnted section of our forum.      And don't forget our poetry sections, you would be great at that too.
