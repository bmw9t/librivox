Hi, I'm new here, so hello to all.

I'm a huge fan of William Blake and would be very interested in reading for the First Book of Urizen.  Assuming that it went well, I would consider following on with the Song of Los.  

I've searched and I don't think either of these has been covered yet - does anyone else know better?  Anyone want to give any advice?

Cheers

S
