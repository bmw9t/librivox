Since they really are part of the book, we should add another section on, don't you think.     I'll claim it right now!! I would love to do the songs. Can't promise anything spectacular, but I can sing - and looking through them, I know most of them, and I'll try to find the tunes to the rest. If we can't find the tunes I can always just read the ones I don't know. Sound like a plan???YES!  YES.      What a great idea.  I had thought this would be too much to ask of someone,but I would love to include it.  Can you add a section?
