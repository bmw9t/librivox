...I should give credit where credit is due.  It was Adrian Pretzellis (sorry if I've got the spelling incorrect) who read Treasure Island in such a way that I was smiling and laughing out loud. I appreciated so very much all his effort to make that a great story. I'd love to read something like Jane Austin or Louisa May Alcott...along those lines. I'd love to read some good books that I've maybe not even read myself yet! How fun will that be!  Ok, I guess that's enough of an intro.  

I will eventually work on the next steps, which seem to be to download the software and ...send a sample? Am I correct?

Then...pick a book?  

Thanks!
