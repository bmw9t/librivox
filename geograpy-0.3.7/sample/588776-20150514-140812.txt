If there are any missing, let me know. http://www.specksynder.com/librivox/timberwolfmage/hamlet_narrator_shakespeare.mp3In blatant plagiarism of Gesine's excellent system for the Twelfth Night narration, I've got a list with the times of each scene. I got rid of most of the repetitions within scenes, so if you're looking for something and it's not where it's supposed to be, chances are it's somewhere earlier.

Thanks!
