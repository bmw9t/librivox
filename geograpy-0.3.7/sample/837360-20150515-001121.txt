Hi--

I think I would like to record Abigail Adams' "Remember the Ladies" letter as my first project.  However, it's not just the one letter that's important, but rather the exchange with John Adams.

How does one proceed with this?  I presume it's all one recording.

Would I do something like:
1)  List both Abigail and John as the author
2)  Read
     ABIGAIL ADAMS TO JOHN ADAMS Braintree, March 31, 1776
     <letter text>
     JOHN ADAMS TO ABIGAIL ADAMS April 14, 1776
     <letter text>
     ABIGAIL ADAMS TO JOHN ADAMS Braintree, May 7, 1776
     <letter text>

Or do these need to be split into separate recordings?
