Hi Marti,

in a fairy tale I would drop the footnotes. 
In other texts we normally say "foodnote ... text ... end of footnote" where they appear in the text or at the end of the sentence. In group projects with many footnotes there sometimes are special rules for the footnotes.

Oh, and there is a fairy tale collection going on here:
