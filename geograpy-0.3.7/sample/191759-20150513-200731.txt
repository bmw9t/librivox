Maggie,I've gotten to a place where I can upload, so the corrected 11 is now in the uploader.I'll check 2 and 4.Please plan on re-recording 10 - the volume is very very low and it's short . . . so on balance, better to re-record than to try to amplify and clean as much as it needs to bring it within spec.MaryAnn
