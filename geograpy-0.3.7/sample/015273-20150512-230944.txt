Greetings friends.I'm Damon Gray, living in Washington State.  I'm a techie/geek, working in IT for an engineering firm.  I'm also a full-time graduate student, so life is quite full.  I'll do some reading/recording at some point in the future, but right now, my calendar is packed.  I stumbled across LibriVox because I have a daily commute and was buying books on CD to listen as I drive.  I was thrilled to find the recordings here.  Am currently listening to The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. Fascinating work!Thank you all for providing this wonderful service to the community.- damon
