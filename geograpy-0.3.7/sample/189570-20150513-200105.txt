Better - thanks!Volume is really high overall, and on the loud parts you have clipping which causes distortion. For this recording I suggest:First, de-amplifying the whole thing by 3 dBThen, the Compressor effect with Threshold set at -13 dB, Ratio set at 3:1. This will lower the loudest parts to make it a bit more even overall. But for future recordings, make sure your wave forms do not hit the top or bottom of the Audacity window. You can go to View / Show Clipping, and it'll put a red line where you're hitting maximum.7:27 - stumble: "on the cushion's ve...on the cushion's velvet lining"7:50 - I hear "swung by seraphim whose foot-falls" but text has "swung by angels whose faint foot-falls"8:33 - stumble: "on this desert land enchanted"9:28 - I hear "Be that our sign of parting" text has "Be that word our sign of parting"
