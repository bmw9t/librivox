Oh, that would be perfect, especially since Laurie Anne recorded 20 already.

As for statistics ... David, which is the podcast where Cori did the stats for the first time (and you interviewed your brother)? That was the most fascinating wonderful brillig stats report I've ever heard (and it's true that I've missed a few, but only a few). I recommend a look at the March Madness thread, too.

Thank you one and all!
