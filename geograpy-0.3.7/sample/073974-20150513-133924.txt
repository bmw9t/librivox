There is also a noticeable click at the end of the closing 5-second silence.  You can either let the recording run a bit longer and then trim it, or trim it right at the end of the last word and then use the Generate function in Audacity to add the silence.  There is also quite a "hollow" or "in a can" ring to the recording.  But, I'll let Phil or one of the admins. make the final call on your test.Glad you want to record something for this project, so check back in!
