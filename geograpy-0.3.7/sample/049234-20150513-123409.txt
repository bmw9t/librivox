I would like to BC Because I Could Not Stop for Death by Emily Dickinson whenever a week is free.    It's from poemhunter.com: http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/because-i-could-not-stop-for-death-712/Because I could not stop for Death--He kindly stopped for me-- The Carriage held but just Ourselves-- And Immortality.We slowly drove--He knew no hasteAnd I had put awayMy labor and my leisure too,For His Civility--We passed the School, where Children stroveAt Recess--in the Ring-- We passed the Fields of Gazing Grain-- We passed the Setting Sun--Or rather--He passed us--The Dews drew quivering and chill--For only Gossamer, my Gown--My Tippet--only Tulle--We paused before a House that seemedA Swelling of the Ground--The Roof was scarcely visible--The Cornice--in the Ground--Since then--'tis Centuries--and yetFeels shorter than the DayI first surmised the Horses' Heads Were toward Eternity--p.s. I'd also love to do more then one week if you need someone.
