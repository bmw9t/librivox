So post-chapter 6 I got a new mic. I'm still fooling with it. I was sick of the background noise of the old one (because, I presume, it was audio I/O). The new one is both USB and noise-cancelling. I've tried everything to get the record level up a bit higher, but the only way I've managed is to amplify in post.

Suggestions would be welcome, and I'll take care of the edits as soon as I can. As for 11, I'll upload it again tonight.

Cheers,
Kalynda
