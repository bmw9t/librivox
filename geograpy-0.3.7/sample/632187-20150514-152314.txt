notes for chapter 18:

05:04 "weal" should rhyme with "seal"
10:49 a repeat: "he..."
11:40 a repeat: "for Cedric never..."

notes for chapter 19:

06:49 missing sentence: "the mules may transport the litter", before "and we have led horses" (see text)
08:13 "unintentionally" read instead of "intentionally"
10:01 a repeat: "as belonging to..."
16:01 "vizard" should rhyme with "wizard"
16:30 "waiting in his return" read instead of "waiting his return"
17:09 "ease" read for "else"

With this, I have prooflistened to all the chapters read by Kristin so far. I've rather made some pedantic comments, I'm afraid, so just look and decide what you think necessary to correct, and ignore the rest
