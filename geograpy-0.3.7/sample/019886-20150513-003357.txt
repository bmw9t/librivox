Hi everyone,

I am a music teacher working the Chicagoland area. I came across librivox recently while browsing audiobooks on booksshouldbefree.com. I have always been interested in developing voice acting as a side hobby/job, but as a second year teacher I have not been able to commit the time to pursue it. I was delighted to find out that I could volunteer with librivox as a reader. I see this as a perfect opportunity to build my experience doing something that I genuinely enjoy! I love to read, and I love to read out loud. I'm told that I am clear and articulate, but I suppose that will have to stand the test... 

Looking forward to collaborating with everyone!
