Hi Bryan

I will PL Chapter 6 tomorrow morning Aus time.  It is time to cook dinner here.

I live in Noosa Shire which is a major surfing area.  We hold the Australian long board championships each year.  I think that long boards were the in thing at the time of this voyage.

My wife used to be a semi-professional actor and trained under a US actor in Adelaide and his forte was "sight reading".  He has, since returning to the States, made a good living from voice parts.  His web page is at:

Note the sales blurb at the bottom of his home page.
