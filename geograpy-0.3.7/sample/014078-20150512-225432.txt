greg-Much of the Noise Removal overuse comes from the fact that we have a very broad range of technology being used, and some of the mics (especially the analog ones) result in an almost unusable product with system noise that's not ambient.  There's often an impulse in that situation to NR the crap out of it, with the common misperception that it's also getting the noise out from the words as well.  A lot of what we do in helping new readers is trying to help them improve their signal and record as little of the noise as possible in the first place.  A little attention to the recording environment can often go a very long way for our readers, and when they first start, often times they haven't thought about it much (which is totally understandable!).The majority of readers, though, don't have great equipment, and don't have acoustic interventions, so we work with what we have, and that makes it a bit of a fun challenge!   Here's a start-up guide on Audacity (there's a lame encoder plug in that allows mp3 export):http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/Audacity_1-2-3and http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/Audacity_TutorialsI've been going through and trying to update some of these over the last week or so, but I think the basics are up to date. Great to have you aboard!Dennis
