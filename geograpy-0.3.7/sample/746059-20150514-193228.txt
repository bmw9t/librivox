Uploading.  I've added a suffix to the file name, which can be stripped off:  FINAL followed by a number,  in case of last minutes changes.  So the highest FINAL number for each file is the one to use.

EDIT ... No.  There are problems with the uploader for me. I'll put them on Mediafire this evening.
