Greetings from Oregon!
My Husband and I are new, starting last night. Late last night! Already we have come head to head with the nuances of Audacity and our recording headset. I think its called....volume control? 

I am very excited! We have both already recorded the Garden Fairies poem as our trial run to make sure we have all the in's and out's. Of course we have to edit it out all of the kitty meows and our heater turning on mid-recording. It just happened and I had quite a chuckle!

I am a team player so if you need help on anything, let me know. I have no problem starting small but I am already picking books I want to read once I am all comfortable and such. 

Did I mention I am excited?

Happy New Year to all! And to all a safe night!
