I just listened to that test. Hard to locate. After extracting, finally found Female Basic #1, 2, & 4 AIFF Format files thru Media Player. All three were fine. In an actual recording, may have to boost volume a little. Other than that, good to go. Just make sure you save recordings as mp3. Pleasant voice. -- dread
