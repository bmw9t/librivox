Thank you, Aussie, well done! See mim's note above. Would you please let me know the file duration?

As for noise-cleaning, please look at the LibriVox wiki: http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/Main_Page - look for the section on Volunteering and within that at Editing. There are two noise-cleaning tutorials, one with pictures. Any problems, please give us a shout.
