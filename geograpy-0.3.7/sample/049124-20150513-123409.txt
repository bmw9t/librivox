I was planning on doing Winter, but the English author, Walter de la Mare died in 1956. I am certainly no expert on PD-stuff, but that seemed more recent than usual. Isn't UK-copyright law life +70 years? Or, per the first post in this thread, Quote:To keep the weekly poem available to as many readers as possible suggested poems must have been published before 1923 and the author must have died in 1941 or earlier. Anyway, at this late hour, rather than wait for a response, I'll play it safe and do "A Wet Sheet and a Flowing Sea" instead. Liberty
