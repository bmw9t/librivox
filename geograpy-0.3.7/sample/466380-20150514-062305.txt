I suggest, if you plan on reading a lot of this aloud, to get a good hard copy that's reliable, and use that instead. I read Dombey and Son all the way through for librivbox, and didn't use the gutenburg version at all, but my own hard copy. If you do find another version, let us know, since we want to make sure that we're consistent on the version we're using.NerdanelNo No No - you must all use a Pd text - and the same one. I did notice it was not as well set out as some of the others - maybe it was early - but reading from hard copies leads to disaster - you were lucky to get away with it - several soloists have had to redo bits - one had done about 2/3rds of the book.AnneChecking mis prints , mis scanned bits is OK though
