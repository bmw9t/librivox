Wouldn't it work just as well if we posted our votes to the thread and once all votes were in, the moderator would reveal the outcome? Maybe someone can 'splain to me what I'm missing.Thanks!

Great question!  When I played this in another forum, all votes were posted in the thread as you suggested.  We did this for quite a while, but came across a big problem.  If all the definitions are good ones, a lot of time, players have no idea which one to choose.  When they first start seeing the votes coming in, they actually have a strong influencial effect on how everyone else votes.  ("eh...well, it was between these two, but I see everyone's going for #11, so that's more likely to be correct.")  

We saw this happening and so we tried doing it by PM.  After that, we noticed that there was a wider variety in what people were voting for, so we figured it made the game a little fairer and more interesting.
