Everything has been well-said by Nicholas - I'm just repeating.  We are all volunteers here, and many readers are very nervous picking up a microphone for the first time (or even the hundredth time!).  We have few policies around here, but one of them is "No Unasked-For Criticism", and this is absolutely enforced.  http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/Forum_Policies

Our proof-listeners are important volunteers who make sure that our recordings are edited properly and that the technical specifications are correct.  They are specifically asked NOT to comment on text content, reading style, speed, pronunciation, or accents.  All accents are welcome, and pronunciations vary throughout the world, and throughout time, as Nicholas said.  We've had several posters make themselves look very silly by saying a pronunciation was "wrong" when it was just a regional or temporal difference.

Here's what our wiki advises proof-listeners:

LV wiki wrote:We try to catch things like long silences, repeated text, editing problems, volume problems, static, etc. But we don’t really make comments on reading style — too fast/too slow, not enough oomph. For instance, we never say: “This reader is not good enough for LibriVox.”Our policy is to accept ANY reader who wishes to read for us. We have such a huge task ahead of us: to record all the books in the public domain! We can’t achieve that without an open door policy for everyone who wants to help. Plus, it’s part of the LibriVox way. We welcome anyone who wants to help. That’s how we got this far, and we want to go a lot further. 

Pick up a microphone and join us.
