I just saw where I needed to fix my tags...I also see that the book is complete.So did someone edit the tags, or should I do that and resend?Thanks also.Sorry for the mix up.TonyHi Tony,Yes, the tags were fixed before they were catalogued.  Normally, we don't have the reader resend their recording if it is only the tags that need to be fixed because we don't have a lot of server space.  The more files that get sent in, the more space it takes up, so it is just easier to fixed them before it gets catalogued at Archive.  But thanks for checking, and reading for this project!
