Many thanks to TriciaG for juggling things while I was away.

I was helping my father get his car back from the dealership in Los Angeles, where it was being repaired after breaking down on Sunday. On the way, I got food poisoning, so it really has been an eventful day.

Now, RobinC
Anyway, normally, the practice is to assign the chapters to the person who requests it first, but if you're fine with taking chapter 3 instead, then I will happily assign it to you.

Accordingly, I'm assigning the 2nd section to Rebecca and the 3rd to you.

Since you're new here, please let me know if you have a preference for a particular catalogue name (usually one's real name, in full or in part) and if you have a personal URL, like a website or blog, that you'd like to be linked from your catalogue page.

Thank you for your interest in this project, and welcome to LibriVox! 

DrBeccaAnne:
Thanks for your prompt submission. You've made me feel guilty about neglecting my claimed chapters in the other group project I'm BCing.
