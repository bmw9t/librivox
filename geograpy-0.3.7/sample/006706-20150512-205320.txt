Hello.Greeting from a fellow taciturn-in-real-life person  Go through your welcome e-mail. It has lots of important info including links to helpful materials. If you have already deleted it, you can find the text in the "New Here?" section under "New user FAQ". One thing that I find especially commendable is Phil's videos. You can find them in the "New here" section too. There are some really great Audacity tutorials among them  Have fun
