Since my french is rusty, I may have mispronounced some of these words. Let me know if I made any egregious errors.The Gutenberg Project's transcription contains the non-word scarabseus. I think it was meant to be scarab√¶us, and it makes sense in context so I have recorded the latter. clarkej0 wrote:Submission 2https://librivox.org/uploads/bart/ghohor025_idledaysonyann_dunsany_jac_128kb.mp3Original Text: http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13664Author: Lord DunsanyTitle: Idle Days on the YannDuration: 42m11s Excellent job on both, Alex--thank you!
