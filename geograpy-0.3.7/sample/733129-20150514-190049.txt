I missed that correction; I'll get it sorted this evening. Thanks for pointing it out, Dalmoz.  By the way, when you spot errors like this, could you make a note of the time in the recording at which they occur, please?  It saves a bit of hopping around the sound files.  Thanks .. I appreciate your help; I do try to be as near word perfect as I can.

I'm still with this project, but my voice is still a bit croaky from a recent infection, and Alice needs a lot more control than the 1001 Nights which I've been also doing.
