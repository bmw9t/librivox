Howdy y'all!

My name is Lawrence, and I'm from California. I'm a full-time professor at a local community college. As well, I am a bibliophile. I bet you are too.

I'm married--just hit the five year mark--and 28 years old. The RPCV in my name comes from the fact that I am a Returned Peace Corps Volunteer. My wife and I served in Ukraine from 05-07. I do speak Ukrainian, not Russian, so I am excited to record some poems from Taras Shevchenko for LV. I'm quite sure there are more in the PD that I can record as well.

I'm a writer. I'm currently finishing my first novel, a fantasy novel, and will start to record it for www.podiobooks.com in an attempt to build an audience for it.

My favorite authors are Stephen King, Cormac McCarthy, Raymond Carver, and Charles Bukowski--to name a few.

That's all for now. I'm happy to have found this place, and I'm pleased to meet you.
