thank you guys so much for answering me. Well, I'm afraid you got me wrong. Hm, here is the thing. I only want to do a few chapters or something very short first, but I can see that there are many chapters "completed", many other "assigned" and a few have still been available. So, the thing I'm asking here is that, can you show me the way to ASSIGN those chapters? So the Admin Team would know that I want to do those chapters? Thank you so much for any reply
