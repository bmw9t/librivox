I have uploaded #06 -- total time 30:13.     However, the mole on the princess's nose is at 20:48.    I was able to edit all my mistakes out and smooth things pretty well for the entire track. Once I read "that" instead of "which", and there are a couple of slip ups (I added the word "unto", and I left off the text reference once but the natural flow and meaning is retained. But at 20:48 I had substituted "that" for "with" at one point and the meaning was changed and so I re-recorded my "with" and cut the "that" out. It sounds awful, but I don't know what else to do accept re-record the whole chapter next week when I am in a quiet environment and I already have several hours of editing plus the nearly hour it took to record. So I have tried this unseemly edit. Please hurl stones softly.This is my very first chapter of recording for Librivox. Would appreciate input from the listener/proofer.
