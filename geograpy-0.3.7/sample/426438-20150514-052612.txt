[quote="frank k"]Hello friends, some technical PL comments:Noel: Is the Zoom H4 the same as Algy's Zoom H4N?  The volume level sounds good, in audacity it looks a little low but that's ok, we're going by how it sounds. What's strange is it sounds to me there's a little distortion going on, as if from over amplication whether in hardware or software. What's your mouth distance and relative position to the Mic? Hi Frank!Mouth distance to mic is about three inches, with mic to one side and about three inches lower than mouth.  Because levels look so low in Audacity, mybe I've been getting a bit too close?
