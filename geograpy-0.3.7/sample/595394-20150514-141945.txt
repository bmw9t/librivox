Notes for chapter 20:

-at ~02:49 the word "gunpowder" is missing. He was determined to discover if he could what Zachary intended to do with the gunpowder.
-at ~04:48 the word "shirt" is sligthy repeated Zachary then put the candle on the corner of a packing case and from under his shi... shirt pulled out the coils of the fuse Chris[150] had seen a few days before.
-at 06:23 "and lit" missing Just before the candle went out, Zachary's fuse coil reached a group of molasses barrels, and here the young man decided that the fuse, when the time came, would be hidden and lit.

Otherwise OK, beautifully read
