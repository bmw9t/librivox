I edit files when the PL has been complete for an age (month or longer) and the reader is not one I recognize, especially when it's just a repeat or needing to add silence. It's less work for me to edit it than it is for me to track them down.

But I am now speaking as a BC! I do not think it's proper for a PLer to edit a file. What I want is a PLer who posts repeats, etc in the thread and lets us decide whether they need to go. 

Tho to be sure, everyone is welcome to edit my own files, because I hate to edit out repeats and stuff like that on my own files.
