My first [non-test] recording using the new microphone:Section: 12 - The dream as wish-fulfilmentURL: http://upload.librivox.org/share/uploads/kd/interpretationofdreams_12_freud.mp3Length: 28:25It sounds weird compared to what I've gotten used to, and I'm sorry to admit I had to edit a few Ps & WHs that got away from me. But about the Intro/Outro: there's "Chapter" on the Page One version where Google Docs has "Section"; I went with "Section".Now, the section I was about to ask for turns out to have French in it, as did the next two I looked at. Section 33, however, has a bit of German, unsurprisingly, and even some Latin, which is more my speed: please assign me ["Examples- Arithmetic and Speech in Dreams"] Section 33.Thanks!
