Yes of course, we all make millions of mistakes when we read!  

The easiest thing is, when you're recording and you notice that you read something incorrectly, snap your fingers to make a big noticeable spike in the recording and read the offending sentence all over again.  Then, later, look for the spikes and just snip out the mistakes.

If you don't notice the errors until you're listening back, re-record the sentence or paragraph and paste it in over the mistake.  It's best not to try to do this with individual words -- it's certain to sound odd :)
