It took me awhile to recall exactly how I found Librivox, and I'm not even sure I've remember it correctly, I think I discovered Librivox a few years ago, though I can only definitely trace my knowledge of it back to the beginning of 2009. I believe I discovered it through the listings of the Librivox recordings on Gutenberg. But I've been interested in open source software and what I guess you might call the "free internet" or the part of the internet that values freedom, such as Creative Commons, Wikipedia, and of course Gutenberg, and I can imagine a number of different ways I might have heard of it, and it was quite awhile ago.I'm gonna try volunteering for a reading at some point, maybe in a few days.Edit: I did the sample test (link), though it didn't take anywhere near the full minute to read the prompt, and there's static and I breathed into the mic some... I did that recording on my laptop, my desktop has what I believe is a nicer sound card (it's supports surround sound) so I'll try using that tomorrow to see if it might improve the quality. I also have another mic, it uses a usb connection, but I'm not sure if it's better suited or not.
