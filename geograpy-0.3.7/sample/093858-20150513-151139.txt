The files are recorded in the wrong format. (Not Mono) and I would need to listen to both sections to cut out the bad takes.I love science fiction, but I'm regretting I chose this particular story because one of the characters uses some words I shouldn't endorse as someone who works at a Catholic School. I thought at first it would be all right, since this was just going to be a test of how to make an audiobook for myself before working with a group of students who are interested in recording one for themselves. Now I'm worried that the students are bound to ask me about the story I recorded. Also, I need the help of the "tech" expert to fix the format, if its fixable. I don't want to be a prude about this (or spoil the completion date for Astounding Tales 07). I do want to be a part of the good work being done in support of literature at Librivox by contributing a story. What should I do?
