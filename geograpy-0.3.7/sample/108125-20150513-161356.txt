Eeep! So sorry that I've been gone from this topic for a few days!! I was called out of town unexpectedly for a job interview. I'm back now though!Availle and Peter, thanks so much for the recordings! I'll put them up in the window and I should be able to PL them by the end of tomorrow   Tortilla, I'll sign you up for Adah! And Libby, I'll sign you up for the Angel! As Availle pointed out, the Angel's first two lines in Act 3 are tagged as "A Voice from within," just as a heads up!And now we're only one role away from being completely cast! I'm so excited for this to come together!Thanks!!Sarah
