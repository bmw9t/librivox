I don't have a lot of time, but it might be interesting for folks to look at http://www.qwikly.com/2006/02/wikipedia ... books.html which seems to be talking about a place where folks can catalog their own libraries of books in a shared environment, with an API that relies on Library of Congress data.  I will for sure be looking more later, when I'm not running out of lunch break.
