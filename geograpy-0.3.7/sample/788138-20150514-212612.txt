Harvba -- 24, 32, 43 are yours!  Thanks :)

I've finished ch. 1 and ch. 22.  You can listen to them, if you want:

I haven't read this book since I was a horse-crazy child.  I remembered it being good, but now that I've read my two chapters, I remember how VERY good it is!   Wow.  It's tempting to snatch up a  few more chapters, but I'll wait a while ;-)  Enjoy reading, everyone!

Let's add the author's chapter title to the ID3 tags.  I'll change the first post.  If you've already submitted your file, don't worry about it, I'll change your tags.  My fault for not planning ahead properly. :)
