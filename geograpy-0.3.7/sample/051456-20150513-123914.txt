I realise I'm late to the party and that this is Vol 2!  Beth,I heard about "Non-Combatants and Others" on a BBC WWI podcast (here:  http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b047bs6t) and have marked it as a book that I would like to see read as a solo by someone.  My list of "to read" books is pretty long . . . so who knows when I will get around to it.  But you might consider whether it is something you are interested in . . . and whether an excerpt might fit for this collection.  It's on Gutenberg here:  http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35807MaryAnnHmm. That one doesn't grab me at the moment. I'm BCing a group project of "Men, Women and Guns" so I might find another chapter in that one that would work. I know Noel did the Prologue already, so I'm reading the Prologue for the collection!
