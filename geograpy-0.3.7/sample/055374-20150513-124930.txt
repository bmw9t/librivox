On page 8-11, in the paragraph under the heading "Examples of Preventive Maintenance" they used the term 'Alternation' where it should have read 'Alteration'. There also appears to be an orphan paragraph at the top of page 8-12. It refers to checking the performance of a magnetic chip detector before flight. The paragraph immediately before it was talking about panel-mounted equipment. (No bullet between.) There is no apparent connection here as the chip detector is located in the oil pan of the engine. I went ahead and read the orphan anyway.  Also, would you go ahead and put me down for Section 35?Thanks,ArtFantastic!     MW updated with submission of Section 32 and for Section 35.  Nice job on spotting misspelling and the orphan paragraph!  I wonder what got dropped in between the two paragraphs?  Bruce found several bad links and let the FAA know. You can let them know or I can.  Their email is AFS630comments "at" faa "dot" gov.  They have been collecting errata (of varying significance) for quite a while so one day they should release an update, but considering the budget I suspect they will be adding to the errata list for a while. Great job and Thanks!Norm
