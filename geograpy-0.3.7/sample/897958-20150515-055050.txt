Wow Hazel, that is intense! Id actually never heard of that particular book before.It did make me feel good to see that so many of the books that had been previously banned in America are now required High School reading. I read at least ten of them in my English classes, and I feel thats a good sign.I have a friend that is currently in China, and while she loves it over there she has a hard time dealing with the censorship. Even within the school the internet will randomly be shut down for days or weeks, and she said you just stop noticing it after a while, which is exactly what they want.We're all very lucky that we can even participate in a site like Librivox!
