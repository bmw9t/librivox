I don't know the characters, so can you tell me the best, open role for teenaged girl to play?Hi Jessie, thanks for your interest.  How about something like Voice 4 to start out with? Then you are welcome to claim more roles if you're interested. A few things: 1) Could you record a 1-minute test before you start? It's just to make sure that your recording setup is ok. Here are the instructions:http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/1-Minute_TestOnce you've recorded that, post it in Listeners and Editors Wanted, and someone will give you feedback on your technical settings and stuff.2) How would you like your name to appear in the catalog?
