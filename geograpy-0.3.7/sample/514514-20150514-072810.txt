I've been having trouble getting my USB mic to record at a high enough volume, so I brought the volume up manually on my recordings.  I'll just bring them up less or leave them as-is in the future.

I use my full name for everything, and LibriVox certainly isn't something I mind being publicly associated with.  So my credit should read:

Thank you for this opportunity, Cori!  I can't wait to hear the finished play.

Yours,
