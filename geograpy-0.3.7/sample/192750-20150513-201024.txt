Greetings,In initially submitting my request to claim Parts 1 thru 6 of "The Moon Master' by Charles W. Diffin, I forgot to ask; when claiming sections in a collaborative reading, do we wait for approval, or simply start recording our claimed sections until we receive the OK (or denial)?Please respond when you can, I am looking forward to start contributing to this great online literary arena!Many thanks!Regards,Terry D.
