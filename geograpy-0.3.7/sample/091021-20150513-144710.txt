I was planning to DPL this myself, but I'm getting behind so there are quite a few chapters ready for PLing. I'd love a DPL, and I think this would be a great book for it - lots of short chapters! But I'll take any help I can get!This is a book which is a classic novel by a Nobel Prize for Literature author. He wrote in Polish, and his work has been translated into many languages, but he remains (sadly) relatively unknown to most English readers. This is your chance to change that, with a coming-of-age story of two teenagers. It is rather more realistic and gritty than most modern Western writing tends to be. This is my second book to BC by H. Sienkiewicz, and the project link is here: viewtopic.php?f=2&t=52491 Please note that the translator (Max Drezmal) died in 1947, so this work is not Public Domain for Europe and other death+70 countries, although it is PD in Australia (death prior to 1955 means death+50 rule applies.)Magic Window:
