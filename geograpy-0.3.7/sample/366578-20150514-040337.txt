Is it software, or a piece of analog equipment that you're running the recording into?  If it's software then maybe I could get the program and then double check my export to make sure that I'm spot on before submitting. Thanks a lot!ThomasYes, it is a free program you can download.  Google "mp3 gain" and you'll find it. It's best to use it to measure volume only. Do not change the volume with this tool. If it needs to be increased, either increase your microphone inputs or amplify the file in audacity. We aim for around 89 dB, but anything from 84 to 95 is acceptable. If it's lower than 84 it definitely needs to be amplified.  You can also take a look at this thread for checking your tech specs viewtopic.php?f=21&t=36489~Abigail
