hi ashley and welcome to librivox   every new reader is asked to do a 1 minute recording to make sure all their settings are correct, this means that you don't go and spend a long time recording to then find out that your settings are wrong and need to do it again.here is the link on how to do thishttp://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/1-Minute_Testintroduce yourself on the "introduce" thread and also put in your recording, someone will be able to tell you if its ok or not. ( put "test" in the title as well.once you've done this chapter 34 is all yours. i'll put your name by it so no one else asks for it, once you've got the ok post on here to let me know and away you go
