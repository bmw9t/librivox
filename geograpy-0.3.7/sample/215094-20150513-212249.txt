Ann, I am using Safari 4.1, so it is a bit old. However it does work, it is that I have no indication the file is uploadingYes I need a new Mac and will probable get one next year.KenHave you notice that Chunky is getting more ink then Tad, at least I think so. There has been, too me, a change in Patchin's writing. Interesting. Ned and Walter are almost non-characters . Perhaps Patchin found Chunky to be a very popular character. Tad can be too perfect,.... the classic All American boy. Chunky does have his appeal.....
