Aww, thanks, y'all.  (See, I had to throw that "y'all" in there just to prove that I'm not only american, but currently living in the South.)I'm a total anglophile, so I appreciate it - although I always feel a bit pretentious.  Fortunately I can at least say that I'm married to a half-Brit, go there to visit friends and family regularly, and lived there for a year...
