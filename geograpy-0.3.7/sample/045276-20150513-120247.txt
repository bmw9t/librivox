We only work under the public domain here -- http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/ -- we can't accept recordings with any kind of copyright limitation. However, if you do want to use that licence, you could upload directly to archive.org, where we also store our files, along with thousands of other projects and works. Your project wouldn't be part of the LibriVox collection, but would be findable by anyone searching for the book's title or author.
