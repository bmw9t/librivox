Praise for ahab (Stewart Wills) via the 'Thank a reader' feature:

Quote:I hope this thank-you note finds its way to you.  I just wanted to say thank you very much for your reading of Moby Dick.  In an odd sort of way, I have spent more time with you in the past few weeks while listening to the book during my daily commute (I bike to & from work here in Chicago) than I have with any person in my life.  I'd read the book two or three times before, but I have to say that your reading of it allowed me to enjoy it at a level I hadn't previously experienced.  I thought you did a very nice job voicing the different characters & it wasn't until stumbling earlier today upon a youtube clip of Orson Welles reading the sermon towards beginning of the book that I thought that particular piece could be done better. Well, thank you once again & have a great weekend,Jeremy P
