Thanks to Open-DNS I'm online for now.It means that I will not be able to do a lot overhere and it is very well possible that the code generator will be off-line too.Sorry for the inconvenience. I'll do my very best to solve the problems quickly.BartPS: If you do get the code generator, than you can save it locally and use it that way!I think it's all fixed. I'm back.Happy New Year!Bart
