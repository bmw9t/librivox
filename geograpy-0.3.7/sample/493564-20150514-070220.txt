'tis Christmas morn—Awake and let thy music tellTo all mankind that now is bornWhat Shepherd loves His lambkins well!"Then rang the bells as fled the nightO'er dreaming land and drowsing deep,And coming with the morning light,They called, my child, to you asleep.Sweetly and tenderly they spoke,And lingering round your little bed,Their music pleaded till you woke,And this is what their music said:"Awake and sing! 't is Christmas morn,Whereon all earth salutes her King!In Bethlehem is the Shepherd born.Awake, O little lamb, and sing!"So, dear my child, kneel at my feet,And with those voices from aboveShare thou this holy time with me,The universal hymn of love.At the end of your reading, leave a space and then say:Quote:End of poem.
