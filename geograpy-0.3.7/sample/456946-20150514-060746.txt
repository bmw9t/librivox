PL is complete for Chapters 19 and 31Chapter 19 0:22-0:25 "Messer Bernardo del Nero was ex-" can be deleted because the sentence begins over again.Chapter 310:13 In the second part of the introduction, "Fruit is Seed" needs to be "Romola, by George Eliot, Chapter Thirty One, Fruit is Seed."8:38 I heard: "placed a seat before him."  And in the text was: "placed a seat FOR him."9:26 I heard: "was when he was younger..." And in the text was: "was when he was YOUNG..."Hope this helps,Jean dF
