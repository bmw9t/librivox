Praise for earthcalling (David Barnes) via the 'Thank a reader' feature:Quote:Hi David,I wanted to take this opportunity to thank you very much for your time bringing The Cloud of Unknowing to the LibriVox Collection. You did such a marvelous job reading this seminal work of spiritual literature. Your impeccable style of vocal expression and overall tone keeps the reader captivated and very in tune with the important messages in this book. You read it in a way in which the author himself would likely narrate it - as a friend passing on simple wisdom attained with substantial effort. I also listened to it at the time in my life that I needed to hear this work very much - that makes it very special to me!If LibriVox ever decides to add the sequel to The Cloud (The Book of Privy Counseling) to its collection, I am sure I am not the only LibriVox listener to wish to hear it narrated by you. It is indeed difficult to imagine it being narrated by someone else; I think that speaks for itself.Again, my heartfelt thanks for this and all other work that you are doing for LibriVox.Best Regards,AntonQuote:A big thank you to David Barnes for his reading of St Julian of Norwich’s Revelations of a Divine Love. I am studying theology and was able to listen to this medieval classic while doing things around the house. I also got a Distinction for my assignment. I could tell through David’s reading that he could relate to the subject matter. Thanks again,PaulAll of David's recordings
