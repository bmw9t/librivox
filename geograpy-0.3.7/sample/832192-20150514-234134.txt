Please keep also in mind that especially foreign languages (and to a lesser degree accents of other native speakers) are always potential minefields. 

Appearantly Guidall consulted speakers of Jiddish but somehow he missed to consult any German. The constant mispronunciation of "Appellplatz" as "Appelplatz" (="apple place") shows however, that nobody is perfect, and and that there was a real person in front of the microphone, not just one perfect voice generator.
