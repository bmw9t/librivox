So it's not worrisome, but if you'd like to bring the volume closer to the 89-90dB target range, this file now measures ~93dB, a 3-4 decibels difference.it is always possible to bring the volume down during cataloging, but if the volume of a section is very high, there is always a danger of clipping. if sections are just loud, but not clipped, that should be fine.if the volume is too low, thats another thing. i personally try not to catalog any sections below 87 db, to make sure the difference between one chapter and the next is not too great
