Well Tina,that's some heavy noise there. Please try the following and see if the results sound better to you then your first try (if it's better, then only a tiny bit)1)Notch filter:You have a deep hum at 48Hz. Getting rid of that first has a better chance for the noise removal effect to work good.Mark the recording (Strg-a) and go to Effekt->Notch Filterand use48HzQ=12)The Rauschunterdrückung works in a funny way, doing it 2-times with smaller numbers works often better than one time with a higher number. So please apply it 2 times with Absenkung on 10dB, the other values can stay where you had set them.Please try these steps and listen to the result. You will hear there is some noise left in the "silent" parts, but I think it sounds more natural this way. Upload your results once more and post here when it's ready.Und dann solltest du sehr bald loslegen können!Viele Grüßemahne
