Do you want it in the narrator file or separately?Also, I have another narration file still to do - I haven't forgotten! I had done half of it but realized there was a ridiculous amount of background noise from the kids, so I will need to redo it.Thanks Beth!  You can either send it separately or recorded in the end of your next narration file, if you happen to do them in the same recording session.SweetPea wrote:Oh my, what fun!
