Vorble,I posted the above comments before I realized you had a second thread with a second test.  I've merged it all together in one spot.The second test is fine on volume - 89,8 dB.I'll mark your thread OK, head on over to one of the readers wanted forums, put in a few claims and get started reading!  Do watch the popping Ps going foward.  I didn't notice any background noise on the second test.MaryAnn
