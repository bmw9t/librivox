Here it is. Had to wait until I got home and wait for a quiet spot between the howls of cats and babies. It's a bit hissy, but I've not done my usual treatment, just adjusted for volume and left it as is.

Recorded on Creative MuVo N200 on a full-size mic put through a Behringer PB100 pre-amp to boost the signal, and into the line-in port.

In Sony Sound Forge:

1. Changed from single-channel stereo to mono

2. Raised the volume

Usual clean-up for hissing not done.
