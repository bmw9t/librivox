Window is up -let me know if its not right.
Re date of death for author for countries where copyright is death + something - it needs to be the translators death . However as it was translated in 1843 I can't see him being alive in 1938 to cause problems.
And I notice the first one is called Book One and this Book 2  - do you care ?
