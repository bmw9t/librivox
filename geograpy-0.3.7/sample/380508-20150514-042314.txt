HEY!  It's my team!I'm thinking of getting a new microphone before I start, so my perfectionist, obsessive side doesn't tell me I need to keep re-recording and fixing stuff I've already posted (in other words, making my life - and yours! - easier).I'll do a little research on this site, but if either of you have ideas (under $75), let me know.Really looking forward to this.Merry Christmas, while I'm at it!KW
