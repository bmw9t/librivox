Although I am new to Librivox, I have thoroughly enjoyed listening to several of the volunteer recordings. Now, I would like to become a volunteer but have a few specific questions. I am totally blind, but can obtain Braille copies of most books in the public domain. When working with any computer application, I use a program known as JAWS for Windows. Does anyone have experience with this program, and do you know whether the Audacity software would be compatible with screen-reading software? If not, are there less direct methods of accomplishing the same goal--that is, to make recordings available to the public? I would appreciate your feedback.
