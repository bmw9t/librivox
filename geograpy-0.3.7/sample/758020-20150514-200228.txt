The inbox for security. If someone uploads illegal files there and I do not notice it at once, it could be used to distribute them through the internet and I am liable for it. Therefore you cannot download files in the inbox, only from the project sites. There is a link in the Uploader for each of the projects.
The project for "Story Girl" is here:
