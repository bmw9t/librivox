Well, I am grateful for the suggestions, from detailed to casual.  I think I might TRY the Darvinia method and see what happens.  I like being able to read from the screen, but I was missing being able to notate anything....I guess the time stamp method is good...too...becuase then you know where you are.But it does sound like a lot of work!
