The Woman Who Did by Grant Alan (read by Ruth Golding) should make for a wonderful book club. It's a very sad and very beautiful book. Really, one of the best books I've ever read. I would wish to open a book club about it on july 18th, if it's possible. We can have a long discussion about some messages in the book. I hope Ruth will join...
