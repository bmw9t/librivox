Section 23 PL OK!I noticed a few spots where it sounded like you edited in one word (such as a couple instances of the word "dollars"). The differences in sound weren't jarring, but I did notice them. As a suggestion to improve your recordings in future, I suggest when you need to replace a word, re-record the whole phrase or sentence, and then cut/paste in either the word or phrase (if the cut can't be made cleanly on one word). This will help the vocal inflections to sound more natural, rather than patching in something that doesn't have the correct intonation for that particular spot in the sentence.It's not a huge deal; like I said, it wasn't jarring, and a couple spots I wasn't sure if it was an edit or not.  But I thought I'd mention it.
