Hi I am Matt B. from New York, hoping to bring my voice to Librivox. org. I've been listening to the Itunes podcasts for months now, and decided that it's time to lend a hand to record the books that are on the public domain. I especially want to record works by one of my favorite authors, Virginia Woolf. I would like to record East of Eden by John Steinbeck, but that is yet to be in the public domain. Since I'm new, I'm wondering how I start recording "Mrs. Dalloway" by Virginia Woolf. I have Audacity, and years of theatrical experience, so I'm very excited to begin!
