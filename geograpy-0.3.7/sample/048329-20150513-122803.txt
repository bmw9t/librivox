That's brilliant! Our first recording in a South Asian language, I believe. You've made a little bit of Libri-history.

If the Kalki book turns out to be disallowed, you could always record it if you can find some way to host the files in India, it's just that unfortunately it couldn't be part of the LibriVox collection.

Anything on this site would be allowed:
