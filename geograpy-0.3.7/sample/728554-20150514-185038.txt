No prob. I can definitely sympathize with scatter-brained.

As for the volume, I'll see what I can do. I'm going to have to play around with the audio settings some more, it seems. Those who have responded in the "listeners wanted" thread mentioned some kind of intermittent background noise. I haven't heard it myself (or, if I have, it's been mixed with the same noise recurring here), but I'm worried that turning the volume up too much will make it worse. 

Like I said... gonna have to play around a bit.

Oh, and I may be sending you an updated recording of the chapter. There's one passage I was having trouble with. Kept tripping myself up and rerecording. Seems there's a "hard edit" that got left in. Gonna see if I can fix it in the next couple of days. Sorry about that.
