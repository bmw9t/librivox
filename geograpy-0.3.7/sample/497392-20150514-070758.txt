Hi, Arielle, 

Oh, I'm so sorry I haven't been able to keep up. I love this book & your wonderful reading of it, & I hate to give it up, but I'm simply not physically able to finish PL'ing it due to Real Life & my health worsening (I'm severely anemic, I recently found out, & am on iron tablets & folic acid, but I'm also having more pain than usual & am also on prednisone right now). 

I have an almost impossible time concentrating on much of anything lately due to my intense fatigue and pain. For me, the more I can sleep, the better. I'm also having a lot of night sweats & hot flashes, not to mention fever due to way too much inflammation in my body. I'm not complaining; just giving you my reason. I'm going to have to give up all my PL projects; I'm just not reliable right now . . . & I'm much too slow. 

I'm also taking care of our 15-yr-old Chi Paco. He has congestive heart failure & is on meds daily for that, as well as a med for an itchy skin condition that has made him lose so much of his beautiful hair.  (He's a long-coated Chi; well, on one side of his body now, bless him.) He's always right beside me here on the bed; he's my little buddy. At least he still plays some with me on the bed every day; the meds are helping, thank God. Well, it's not very interactive play, but he acts silly & jerks around on his side & I encourage him.  Like me, though, he also sleeps a lot. 

I know there are people who will line up to PL this for you & be much faster. I AM going to listen to all of it after it's finished because I want to know what happens. I'm just not up to much of anything right now. Take care & thank you for understanding. 

Joy
