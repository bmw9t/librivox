Hello!  I am the author of these plug-ins, and Steve brought this forum thread to my attention.I welcome your questions, suggestions, criticisms, success stories, relating to these tools.I don't pretend that I have discovered the best settings balancing computation time and quality of results.  The tools have default settings that I use now to treat whole tracks.  Let me know what you discover.
