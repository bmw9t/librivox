Magic Window is up. 

Andy, I have put a few suggestions for section titles in, but these are up to you, of course. My intention was to keep them relatively short, yet give an idea of what the section was about.

btw, should the last word of the summary be Ypres?

We will stay here for a day, then shunt off to Readers Wanted. 

EDIT: Most of the chapters are quite long - particularly Chapters 7 - 9. If you wish to split them, just let me know, and I will add more sections to the MW,
