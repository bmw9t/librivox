Hello cover crew,You're doing a great great job!   I plan to make CD covers for some running projects. Now, I try to make sure that the images are PD and have a question about images of artwork. What is the determining factor for the PDness of images like that http://www.allposters.com/-sp/Soldier-c-1505-10-Posters_i4054871_.htm. The author died in 1510 and it was created around 1509. But a photographic reproduction might be taken after 1923. What is the rule for cases like that? There is an information on wikimedia (for another artwork of the same painter) that says: 'This is a faithful photographic reproduction of an original two-dimensional work of art. The work of art itself is in the public domain for the following reason: This work is in the public domain in the United States, and those countries with a copyright term of life of the author plus 100 years or less. The official position taken by the Wikimedia Foundation is that "faithful reproductions of two-dimensional public domain works of art are public domain, and that claims to the contrary represent an assault on the very concept of a public domain" Well, I have a copy of the picture that was taken from a postcard (date unknown), can I use it? Greetings, Kajo
