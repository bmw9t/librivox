I tried for a while to get it right, but dreaded being mistaken by a real Southerner for a Kentuckian or Georgian!    So I'm using my normal California voice, and hope it will suffice.  Sarah's own voice is so clear and compelling that I'm sure hers will carry the day. I'm glad you've found Librivox, and hope it gives you many hours of enjoyment!  All my best to Baton Rouge when you visit, and Happy New Year to you!JacqueriePS - If you decide you want to keep trying, there are lots of very kind and patient hand holders at Librivox!Dear Jacquerie, I must confess I've already begun listening, and your voice is just fine--very professional, as a matter of fact--and convincing as Sarah.  As you mention, her message has its own strength.  Well I'm off to BR now.  You may vote among yourselves as to whom is the most patient handholder...but I'm afraid I would only be able to read stories related to dogs or wolves, as there is always a background full of barks and howls here, emitted by 4 large canines.  Then there is the husband with the carpentry obsession and the highway being under construction <sigh>.  Ms. Ngasha
