Hi Alessandro

You have a fascinating project going with recording the Pantheisticon.

I was feeling like volunteering to be The President for pages 70-81, but the pagination is crazy: 70-73, 58-62, 81

If you can find a good solution to this problem I will do it.

President, World Pantheist Movement
