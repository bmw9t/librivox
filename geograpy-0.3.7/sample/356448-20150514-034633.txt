I'll have War Brides done within the week.     Thanks,ChristinePL OK!  Exactly the tone I was hoping for!I have it cut into the rest of the parts in the play and now just have to adjust all the gaps and timing.  Should have this ready for PL later today!!Thanks, ToddBefore you finish editing, I suppose I should also tell you that Mr. Nightingale's Diary is PL OK.  With that said, I think cutting out some of my superfluous narration might benefit the production.  It's really entertaining and funny (so many great performances!), but at times my narration slows down the pace (for some reason, I'm the slowest reader of the bunch in this production).  I think some of the descriptive adverbs could be removed, and perhaps the repeated stage directions (ex. "Gabblewig, reading").  But I leave it up to you.  The play is quite good as it is, but if you want to go back and edit it certainly wouldn't hurt it.
