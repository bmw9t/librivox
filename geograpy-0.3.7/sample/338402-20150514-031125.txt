Chapter 1 is PL OK!Chapter 2 has a lot of variation in volume - in some places it's too quiet to hear without turning up the volume, and in other places it's so loud that there's clipping.  I tried using the Leveller on it and it's reasonably OK, but of course not perfect because nothing can fix clipping once it's there... Maybe April and/or Phil want to give a second opinion?ETA: I've listened to a lot of Ginger's recordings and never heard this before... were you maybe turning your head away from the mic? or getting too excited when reading the dialog?
