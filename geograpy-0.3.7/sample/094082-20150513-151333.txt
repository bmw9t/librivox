Hello Erfan! Welcome to Librivox!   I'm not sure how you got the code but here's your link https://librivox.org/uploads/tests/test_-_test.mp3 Your tech specs are correct!   But it is very quiet and I think I'm hearing some pops (when the breath hits the mic). Can you check if you can increase the input volume of your microphone, either from the sound control panel of your system, or from the microphone slider in Audacity mixer toolbar. Or did you de-amplify the recording yourself?Also to avoid the pops, experiment with a different microphone placement/angle. If you'd like, you could use the standard test-text for your next test, as it contains those tricky consonants that show the pops.Please upload a new recording with increased volume and post in this same thread when ready
