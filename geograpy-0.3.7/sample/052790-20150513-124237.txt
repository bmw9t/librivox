I'm tempted to claim another chapter, the one on our "modern" knowledge (sections 67 & 68), to contrast with the ancients, but it will be delivered a little closer to 2 months in than 1, given my queue.   (Also, how do you want the long tables handled, such as on pages 312-314? )  (My "ancients" sections are recorded, I just need to edit them before posting)I agree with Availle, that while word-counts are great, it is an extra step for a topic many may not consider as exciting, to go to the text, check out chapter titles, and make a choice.  But if people see chapter names right in the magic window, they may think "France -- I wonder what France was doing as far as chemical discoveries went" and thus sign on.
