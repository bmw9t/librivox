And, if so, how will the group songs be done?Anyway, I'd like to volounteer for Mr.Gall for now  Hi Fongie,Yes, I want real singing for the songs. Mr. Gall sings a drinking song with a group of men. I can merge the tracks together so it sounds like you are all singing together. He has only a few lines, but they will be fun. I highlighted Mr. Gall's lines in a brown mustard color. He has a group line with the other critics in Chapter 5, " Never read our review!" I think it is highlighted in red.Thanks!-Amy P.S.I'm sure it was noticeable, but I wanted to tell everyone; her lines are in bold blue.
