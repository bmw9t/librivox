That's probably my fault....when I did the Librivox disclaimer, I took it from the title line of the thread. If you want me to fix it, David or Gesine, let me know. My bad.    Shows I'm not not real familiar with this author's body of work. I didn't know any better. It sounded okay to me as just Bernard Shaw.    I see when I clicked on the database entry it's entered correctly there....so there shouldn't be any problem for people searching for it once it's in the catalog.
