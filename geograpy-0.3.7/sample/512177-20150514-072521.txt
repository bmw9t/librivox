Thanks Maryann! We had a family emergency and have been out of town. I'll try to get a chapter or two recorded this week before we leave again. I'll definitely post and let you know when the recordings are up and ready for a PL. Thanks for the reminder to do that.  Ally

PS. Chapter 4 is up and ready.
