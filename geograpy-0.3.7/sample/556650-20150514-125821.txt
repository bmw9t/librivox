Hi Christian, 

 Welcome to LibriVox! 
 Oh yes, Chapter 10 is all yours. Thank you.
 Before you start recording, though, it would be great if you could send in a 1-2 min test recording. We can check the tech specs and other things, and then you'll be good to go.
 Also, if you've got a preference for your catalog name - just a name with which you'd like to be credited on the catalog, and a URL please let me know! 
 Thank you, and have a lot of fun!
