Hello! This is my first time trying to record something for librivox. I have used my mic and audacity in the past, and the levels seem to look fine. But recently, I noticed they are looking quite small (the wave lengths of my recordings). So I turned my mic input all the way up. I made sure my specs were correct, 44100 HZ, 16 bit, etc. and when I tried recording the 1 minute test, my wave form is still looking too small. I thought maybe I'm not speaking loud enough? It looks normal when I go right up to the mic, or I speak really loudly to the point of discomfort, but that doesn't seem normal. I have dropped my mic in the past (accidentally! and only once! but that probably did damage?), I'm trying to figure if there might be anything else I may have missed? Does anybody have any clues? My alternative is to just record it and then amplify it, but I'd like to get to the bottom of this. Thanks!
