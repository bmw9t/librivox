Let me know if anything needs to be changed.http://upload.librivox.org/share/uploads/kd/bookofmormon_25_smith.mp3I went ahead an PLed the recording.  Great job with the tech specs and the reading.  However, you need to add 5 seconds of silence to the end of recordings that are less than 30 minutes (10 seconds for those that are over 30 minutes).  The easiest way on your recording will be to copy the last bit of silence you have on the recording and paste it back in enough times until you have the needed 5 seconds.  Then re-upload and it will be all done.Also, you should post the length of the recording so it can be added to the Magic Window.Let me know if you would like any more sections.   This should be fixed. Clocks in at 20:54.http://upload.librivox.org/share/uploads/kd/bookofmormon_25_smith.mp3This was awesome - if frustrating at times, in a good way. I'd like to claim 26 please.
