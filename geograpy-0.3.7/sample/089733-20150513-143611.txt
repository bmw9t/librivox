Thank you so much for replying and for the suggestions I tried noise cancelling in Audacity followed by amplifying by 2dB. After running through checker, it now tells me the volume is 89.3dB.Here is the new file.https://librivox.org/uploads/tests/test_farheen.mp3I hope two files with the same name won't cause a problem in accessing the correct file.
