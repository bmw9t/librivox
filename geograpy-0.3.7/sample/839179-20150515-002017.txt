I always snap my fingers when I make a mistake (which is a good idea if you don't already, because it makes editing easier), and every one of my files is strewn with finger-snaps at least every 10 seconds.  And inevitably, I have at least one phrase that I simply can't say, even after 10 or 15 tries.  But when I'm done editing, there's no way you could tell what a mishmash my recording was.
That sounds about my speed.
I typically have to delete about 40% of a recording, and the rest of it has to go through a lot of cleanup for noises and artifacts.
