Hi!

A friend of mine introduced me to Librivox about 6 months ago and I am in love! This is such a great outlet for making audiobooks accessible to more people!

Lately, I've been listening to books while I embroider, which is a great improvement from TV because I pay more attention to my needlework......

I am a twenty-something student living in the Midwest (though this is only relevant until December...... ^_^). 

I am so excited to contribute, too! I'm living abroad right now, but once I'm back in the States, I plan on doing some contributions and maybe doing my own project. I love reading out loud, so this is perfect for me! 

So far, I've read the following books from Librivox and have enjoyed all of them!  
Sense and Sensibility
Phantom of the Opera
Mansfield Park
Age of Innocence
House of Mirth
Island of Dr. Moreau

I'm in the middle of Count of Monte Cristo right now.  <3!!

One thing I'm wondering, though, is why there is only one Ayn Rand book on here. I would have thought all of her books would be public domain or all would *not* be. Would it be possible to do Atlas Shrugged and it's just the case that no one's done it yet? (will also post this to the suggestions board)

Thanks!
