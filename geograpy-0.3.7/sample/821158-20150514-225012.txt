It depends on your voice, etc., but here's what I use (on others' recordings where there are a lot of peaks; my own, I think, don't need it):Threshold: -16 dBNoise Floor: -40 dBRatio: 3:1 to 4.5:1, depending on how much it needs to be smooshed (highly technical term)Attack time: 0.6 secsDecay time: 1.0 secsNormalizing depends on how loud you need the final recording to be. Do you use MP3Gain to measure your volume? If so, you can see what your average recording volume is after compressing to determine how much you need to amplify to get to 89 dB. I generally use amplify rather than normalize; it's the same process, but one you tell how much to amplify, the other you tell how far from maximum (clipping) to amplify.
