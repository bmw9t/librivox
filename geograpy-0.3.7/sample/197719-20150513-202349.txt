Missing lines: Balthazar  tekksavvy318ACT 3Bal. In debating which was best, we shall part with neither.Bal. Have patience, sir; O, let it not be so!Herein you war against your reputation,And draw within the compass of suspectTh’ unviolated honour of your wife.Once this,—your long experience of her wisdom,Her sober virtue, years, and modesty,Plead on her part some cause to you unknown;And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuseWhy at this time the doors are made against you.Be ruled by me: depart in patience,And let us to the Tiger all to dinner;And about evening come yourself aloneTo know the reason of this strange restraint.If by strong hand you offer to break inNow in the stirring passage of the day,A vulgar comment will be made of it,And that supposed by the common routAgainst your yet ungalled estimation,That may with foul intrusion enter in,And dwell upon your grave when you are dead;For slander lives upon succession,For ever housed where it gets possession.
