hi the sibilance i mentioned seemed to be more speaker interference which is why i asked others to listen in case my settings are squiffy. if you guys can't hear it or don't need to crank the volume then i'll have to look at them.as for the clicks. well personally i don't think they take away from the book, but they appear to be something that is pointed out across the board. it is understandably difficult to get rid of them. i guess we'll leave it to the experts to what their preferences are.am going to do some more listening now abi
