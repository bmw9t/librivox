Oh, OK, that's fine. That's up to you, Christine, & MaryAnn. 

I wasn't completely sure of marking it, but I've  never heard that pronounciation (& checked Webster's online http://www.m-w.com & dictionary.com; both "spoke" sin-yoo, so I thought that was the only pronounciation). Of course, many words have alternate pronounciations and/or regional differences that don't necessarily show up in dictionaries. I wouldn't have known what word the author meant as it's read. Hmm, maybe it's pronounced that way in England? MaryAnn, I noticed you used the British pronounciation for "privacy," which is great. 

Don't mind me; I'm still learning as I PL (& also learning how to phrase my PL notes).  Also, MaryAnn, I really don't mean to sound picky at all or to discourage you in any way. I think you did a fantastic job with the Cockney dialect! Your emphasis is always spot-on; you're good at dialogue; you're already a great asset to LV!  You made me feel as if I were there--and that's what I think it's all about. I really enjoyed PL'ing your chapters. 

Thanks, Sarah; have a good weekend!
