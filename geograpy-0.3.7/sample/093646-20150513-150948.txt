It does sound a little less full-bodied than the previous recording. Did you have the mic in a different place relative to your mouth? Just amplifying wouldn't have made a difference in sound quality.(Volume on this is still about 3 dB short of ideal, which suggests to me that you did have the mic positioned differently.)
