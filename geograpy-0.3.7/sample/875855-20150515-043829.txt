OK, so I was just bored and curious. Here are a few things of note that I found in our memberlist...

1. There are six and a half pages of members who have joined, but have not made a single post yet.2. Kayray has the most posts at 1566. Then comes thistlechick and hugh.3. There are (very close) just as many users that joined in 2005 (from Sep.) as there that have joined in just the two months of 2006 so far. 

What does this tell me? We're growing fast with a large silent crowd, and some of us spend a lot of time at Librivox (myself included).
