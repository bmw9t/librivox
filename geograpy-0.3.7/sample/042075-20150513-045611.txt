Leni wrote:Hi, MaryI think that is a great idea, and it is great that you are thinking of it in advance!  1) Personally, DRs are a huge effort, and I shy away from them. The BC for such a work has to be really present on the boards, really on top of things and an organized person. Having said that, I know many people love them, so, if there is enough interest, go for it. 2) I think it is an EXCELLENT idea to try and bring all his works to catalog - yes, in English, so that you have a good pool of readers. I would be very much willing to help, BCing some works, if you wish to share the load, and reading for them, certainly. I might consider a recording of the De Vulgari Eloquentia in Latin, just for the fun of it. :p The whole work is less than 12000 words, anyway. But yes, excellent idea. 3) Nothing prevents people from recording his works also in other languages - not only Italian, of course, but French, Spanish... we cannot guarantee anything, of course, but maybe have a multilingual collection of his short poems, if we can find enough PD translations?Thanks for replying, Leni.  1) I've been working on a few DRs recently (not yet as BC on anything, but editing, PLing, text prep), and I'm really enjoying it.  2) Yay! I love De Vulgari Eloquentia.  Hypothetically I could try to DPL, but like I said, my Latin is not awesome. 3) I had thought of that, too! I didn't mention it before since I really only speak English and Italian. But great idea! There's already a Divine Comedy in German in the catalog, and a multilingual Dante short works collection could be a lot of fun. Also, it occurred to me that this thread is my first chance to use this emoticon:
