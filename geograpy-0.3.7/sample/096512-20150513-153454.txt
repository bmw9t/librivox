All the file specifications are correct, Lucas, and there is no intrusive background noise.  The volume is a little high. If it goes too high, this can cause distortion of the voice, so try reducing the microphone volume just a little in Audacity (slider control to the right of the microphone icon at the top of the screen) or in your computer's control panel. Instructions for Windows 7 - other operating systems will have something similar: Click Start | Control Panel | Hardware and Sounds | Sounds | Manage Audio Devices |  Recording | Microphone | Properties | Levels, where you will find a slider control for the mic. To check your own volume you can use our Checker program - see info at http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/Checker.  Make sure you download the version 0.95 - you will find the volume in decibels on the Information tab. For your information, we look for around 89 dB, and your current test measures 93.4 dB. Just one more please, at slightly reduced volume, and you will be ready. Ruth
