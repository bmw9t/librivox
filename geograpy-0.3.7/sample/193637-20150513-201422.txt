OK - linny - MW is ready for you to fill up. Let me know if you need more sections. What's your view on women claiming men's roles and vice versa? might be good to mention that in the first post. And who's going to do the editing? I guess PL-ing is only necessary once the editing has been done? Might be good to ask the PL-er at that time to check against the gutenberg-text once in a while (just spot-check) to make sure no mistakes have slipped into the Google-doc-transformation?Have fun - I suggest we leave the project in the Launch Pad for a day or two longer, so that it will catch people's eye.Anna
