Also, most of them seems to be a reply to what my character says, but I guess if you blend many voices, it won't be heard. Act 1, 06:33https://librivox.org/uploads/triciag/seavoyage_tibaltdupont_1.mp3Act 3, 04:54https://librivox.org/uploads/triciag/seavoyage_tibaltdupont_3.mp3Act 4, 02:21https://librivox.org/uploads/triciag/seavoyage_tibaltdupont_4.mp3Act 5, 02:47https://librivox.org/uploads/triciag/seavoyage_tibaltdupont_5.mp3All, act 3, 00:24https://librivox.org/uploads/triciag/seavoyage_alltdp_3.mp3Ah - finally Archive is working again so I can PL.In Act 1 @1:06 missed a line on page 6 of script - "Over with it ... sav'd it else"            @ 2:57 missed a line on page 10 - "Be men, and rule ... ye are miserable"            @ 2:58 missed first phrase of a line also on page 10 - "Captain, let me correct 'em" before you started at "I'll make ten times worse"            @4:24 missed most of a line on page 14 - you start with "I'll hear none" but then missed "Covetous base minds ...ye do not faint?"            @5:15, the line is printed very poorly on page 15.  You say "off with him hand" but it should be "off with him hand-somely"  (The "-somely" is squeezed in at the end of the line above!)            @6:04 same thing on page 16 with the text on the previous line - "three days hence"In act 3, @ 4:12 on pages 36 and 37 and 38 I think all the lines labeled "Ti" belong to Tibalt even though not with his usual "Tib" abbreviationAct 4 is PL OK!In act 5 @ 1:32 there are some repeated syllables in the page 57 phrase "is capital treason"            @2:32,  I think the 2 page 61 lines marked "Ti" belong to TibaltThe act 3 "ALL" file is PL OKThanks, ToddFinally, they are fixed and uploaded under same name:)
