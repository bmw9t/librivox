Mark:

Sorry that it looked like I was so far behind.  I had been listening a little more faithfully, but hadn't noticed that the MB hadn't saved my notes.  So--I really am here!

It's sounding really great.  This is an unusual Wodehouse, but you're doing a terrific job with it.  Love all the different voices you're using.
