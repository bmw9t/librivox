I've tended to work with the sci-fi and some fantasy audiobooks plus a few non-fiction and whatever may be non-PD in the EU. I haven't done the bulk conversions simply because I don't have fast upload capabilities. As a learning experience, I decided to write my own Mac OS X program to do the conversions since it would give me more control over what went into the files. For example, I can edit most of the standard entries such as chapter names of way too many characters (about 256), but I haven't yet been able to get the lyrics metadata to go in to the files. I'm also working on getting my program to edit existing M4B files  (e.g., delete/replace/add chapters and adjust the audio quality) and have had some success.As a point of reference, my program took about 6.5 minutes to convert a 22 chapter/194MB/about 6.5 hour in length set of MP3 files into a M4B audiobook. About how long do the other programs that are used take?
