Sounds great! Test is OK. You're released into the wilds of recording.   For the record, there's no official pronunciation of LibriVox. But most people pronounce it the way you do here. Your breaths here are just fine, IMHO. People have said that they get unconsciously uptight when they don't hear breaths; it doesn't sound natural. You don't sound like a wheezing rhinoceros, so you're just fine.   I can't think of any other pointers at this time, based off the test. You can always ask for constructive criticism or suggestions when you post sections, if you like.
