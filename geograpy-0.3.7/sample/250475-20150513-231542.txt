You're in, Miguel. Welcome to the project!I see you've done a couple poems already. As long as you've got the volume thing figured out, you should be good to start.There's a small program the spouse of a LibriVoxer developed to check the tech settings. If you're game, you can download it and use it to check the volume. It's here: http://cgjennings.ca/checker/Use the Experimental-0.93 alpha version. We aim for 89 dB, but anything between 87 and 91 is great.
