Nick, please add that last download to the MW (and the file length in the MW), so I can PL it. I learned a long time ago just how much havoc I can make for myself (and others) if I download a file from a thread post before the BC has posted it in the MW. The MW is the MW because that is where the magic truly happens.~Susan
