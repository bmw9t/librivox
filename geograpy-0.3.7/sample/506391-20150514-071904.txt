Welcome, Lucy!

Sections 18-21 are available also, so 26 isn't the first available section. But you can take 26 if you like - it's a little shorter.  And sections usually aren't claimed in order anyway.

How would you like to be credited in the catalog? There are places for a catalog name (some use a nickname, some their real name) and a web site, if you have one. CLICK HERE for an example of what I'm talking about.

Since this is your first recording, you may want to submit a shorter clip (a minute or two) first, so that we can make sure your technical aspects are all correct. It's easier to correct them before recording a section than after.  CLICK HERE for instructions on a one-minute test.
