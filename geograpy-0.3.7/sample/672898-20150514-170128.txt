Hello again, David.

All but Ch 10 are completed. I will post that as incomplete, until I get time to record the ending. I am supposed to put "End of The Heavenly Life, by James Allen" -- is that correct?

By the way, thanks for recording The Imitation of Christ. I wanted that one, and downloaded all your recordings of it.
