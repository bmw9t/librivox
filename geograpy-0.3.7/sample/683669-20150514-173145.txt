Fantastic, Nikolle! I'll be your meta coordinator. Do you have space for the files, or would you like me to store them for you?

What scheme did you have in mind for the meta data (file names, ID3 tags)?

It would be great if you could post an update in this thread (or PM/email me) at least every 4 weeks or so, even if you haven't been able to get much done.

I've added this project in the To Come section of our catalogue.

Have fun with this project - it's a great book and I'm looking forward to this!
