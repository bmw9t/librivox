Linny,Since I have a lotta chapters in this book for my role, is there some way to get to YOUR entire highlighted googledocs file as one document?  I have not figured out how to successfully read off the screen yet.  (Well, the problem is that I get too much outside traffic and room noise near my computer, and also every time I scroll I get a messa electrical noise in my files.)  So I read from printed-out script.  What I usually havta do to get that script is cut and paste the script fragments from each chapter's MW link into one document to print - and I have managed to do that wrong on more than one occasion. (To save all that cutting and pasting I have also gone to the whole document link in gutenberg for a book and discovered then that that document is sometimes different from the MW links - after I submitted a whole narration....)Thanks, Todd
