Earlier this year we read "The Railway Bridge of the Silvery Tay" by McGonagol.  Of course the original failed in a bad storm within two years after it was built.  But if you want to see the REAL railway bridge over the Tay, I found it on Google Earth.  Message me and I'll send you a Google Earth fly-in to it! 

(Got to have yer email address, please) :o
