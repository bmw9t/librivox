Hi TthewW!

That really was fast... and you obviously plan on keeping me real busy. 

Anyway, I just downloaded the sections and hope to have them PLed by tomorrow or day after. I already had a short listening too and everything sounds fine to me. In fact I rather like your reading style... I'll post as soon as I've listened properly.
