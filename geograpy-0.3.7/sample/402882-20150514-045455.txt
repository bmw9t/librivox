Hi Bill:I am looking at Chapter 2, Sections 1 to 3 and it has approximately 4680 words in it. And Chapter 2, continued, starts with Section 4 to 7 and has approximately 4390 words in it. The text says 2000 words. And at this point starts Chapter 3. Am I missing something, or is there an error? I am considering reading these two and don't want to make a mistake. Could you check this out for me?Jules(That is Parts 10 & 11)
