There is already a young reader in the Children's Short Works - http://librivox.org/forum/viewtopic.php ... highlight= - it wouldn't be a bad place to start - , short is easier for first readings    and its nice to get something finished quickly. He could maybe pick something he would read to a younger sibling that he had enjoyed .
