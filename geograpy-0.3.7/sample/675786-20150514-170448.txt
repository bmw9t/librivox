Chapter 41 has a problem, though - there is a series of loud noises between 9 min 30 sec and 10 min 0 sec.Since it affects the speech when I remove them, I thought it better referred back to you.Great work!Hi there, Kmerline!I'm very glad that you like my readings and the characterisations - thanks a lot ! I didn't notice those crackling noises - I wonder where they came from - but I can record a version with 9:30 to 10:000 replaced, and overwrite the old file, if that's the best thing to do .Best wishes,Andy

I wouldn't ask it, but on my equipment they are astonishingly loud.  Yes, a recording with that patch replaced would be just lovely.  Thank you.
