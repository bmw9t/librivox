Dear AllI am a 41 year old South African living in Nairobi Kenya. I came accross the Librivox site while looking for audio books to listen to when I travel. I work for a big American company and my work as a regional sales manager entails quite a bit of travelling. I enjoy history books and have finished listening to "Alexander the Great" by Jacob Abbot and "The Story of the Middle Ages" by Sameul B Harding. Currently I am listening to "History of Julius Ceaser" by Jacob Abbot. I would enjoy adding my voice to your list of readers as I feel that it is a fine way of making books available to people who, like myself, are busy and would like to access them in an audio format. I also think it is an excellent meduim to make books available to the blind community as many of the books might not be available in braille.
