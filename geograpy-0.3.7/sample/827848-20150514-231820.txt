Cori- 
Funny I just emailed you this morning asking about how you do the instant editing on SF. I hadn't seen this post til now. I need to find Sibella's post, I guess, where she described that feature. 

I guess I'm not spending as ridiculous an amount of time on editing as I thought!  

It's easy to bite off more than you can chew when you're just beginning!

Thx,
Dennis
