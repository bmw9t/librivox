I have to say though, this would be my first actual recording for LibriVox, so I might need a little bit of help along the way.I have set you up to read Section 18. But I need a couple of items from you. One is your country of residence (for copyright-clearance purposes). The other is what you want your catalog name to be. It can be the same as your forum name (thehbh), your real name, or some pseudonym.As you move along in your reading, if you have problems or questions, you can post or use a private message (PM). Also, at any time it is possible to send me a one- or two-minute test recording so I can help. If that becomes necessary, let me know.-- dread (Bill)
