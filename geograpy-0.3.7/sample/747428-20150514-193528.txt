standard listening:Please listen for passages that the reader repeated that they likely intended to edit out after they re-read the portion. Also, please note any long pauses that you find disrupt the flow of your listening pleasure, and bad background noise. It is NOT necessary for you to follow along with the text; just listen as you would normally.

Note to readers who have claimed chapters, if I don't hear by the 15th July these chapters are being put up to be reclaimed. 

This is my first attempt at BC. Thanks to fae, I think I am on the way.

How to claim a part, and 'how it all works' here To find a section to record, simply look at point 5. below at the sections. All the ones without names beside them are “up for grabs.” Click "Post reply" at the top left of the screen and tell us which section you’d like to read (include the section number from the left-most column in the reader list, please). Read points 6. to 8. below for what to do before, during and after your recording. New to recording? Please read our Newbie Guide to Recording! Is there a deadline? Target completion date of this project: Date – 30th. June 2007, but try to send your recordings as soon as you can. If you cannot do your section, for whatever reason, just let me know and it’ll go back to the pool. There’s no shame in this; we’re all volunteers and things happen. Where do I find the text?
