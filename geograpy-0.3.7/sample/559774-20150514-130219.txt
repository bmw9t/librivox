I have updated the MW with the combined files.  Mel, are you planning to finish this?  If you aren't able to get back to it, that's no problem; I'll simply open it for someone else to record the last bit of the Tao, and then we can catalog that part.  If you are able to record the Wu Wei later you can do that as a separate project.
