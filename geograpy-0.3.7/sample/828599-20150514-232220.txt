Good morning,
First of all, congratulations for this marvellous web. The idea is splendid and the quality and the rigour of the recordings really excellent.

I'm writing you from a public library in Spain. We are actually creating a new section with audiobooks (actually, we only have a small collection of buyed compact discs with novels from the public domain: zola, poe, spanish authors...). 

I wondered if you would accept we unload some audiobooks from Librivox and we record them in CD's and loan those CD's to our users. First, we would principally unload audiobooks in spanish, but if we receive a good acceptation of this section from our visitants, we would consider unloading audiobooks in other languages: english, french...

I hope you answer me about this idea.
Thank you very much for your attention.
Bye,
Chris.
