Hi guys,
This may have been asked before so apologies for any repetition.
Do you think it is perhaps getting towards the time to seperate out recordings in other languages?
This sounds negative so to put a more positive slant to it, make other language recordings easier to find in the as yet vast majority of English.
Maybe a field in the search archive page for such recordings.
This could encourage other language readers and listeners to make more use of the service.
Maybe there could just be a seperate section for readings in languages other than English at first but with a view eventually to having a distinct section for each language represented.
Many thanks for your superb site.
Roger
