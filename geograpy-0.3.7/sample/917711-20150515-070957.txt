Woot! Good job!

I've decided to keep a food diary for the month, to get a good idea of calories and fat intake. According to my size and age, I'm supposed to eat about 1200 calories a day, which seems incredibly unrealistic to me. I doubt I've ever done that in my life, and I truly don't struggle with my weight very much (this is the first time I have ever had to actively set out to loose weight.) I tried that a couple days ago, eating truly healthy food all day, even, no cheating, and I was starving by the time my calories ran out. I ate about 2000 calories that day in things like salad, tomato soup, and whole wheat toast. If I were truly eating 800 extra calories everyday, I would be massive, so I think I must burn more than your average sedentary gal.

So I'm setting my theoretical target at 1400 to start, no more than 25% fat calories, but I suspect I may need as much as 1600-1800 just to keep my bloodsugar even.
