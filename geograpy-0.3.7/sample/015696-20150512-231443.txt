Hi My name is Philippe and I am French. I enjoy reading and one of my friend adviced me to volunteer at librivox. I can read in French if a project needs it and I would also like to make a try in English (I have already spotted an interesting project I would like to participate in)Thanks a lot and I would be happy with all advices. Cheers !Philippe
