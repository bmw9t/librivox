Hi, Mark, I'm helping Kara out a bit and have added your magic window.  You were planning to include the author's note with Chapter 1, I presume?  If you want it to have its own section, let me know and I'll add it in.

Also, you are welcome to stash files in my folder on Anita's server.  I'll pm you with login info for ftp -- are you set up for that?  If not, then perhaps Mediafire as Kara mentioned unless y'all come up with something else.

I love Mark Twain!  Enjoy!
