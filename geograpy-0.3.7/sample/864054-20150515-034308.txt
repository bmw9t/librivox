Miss stav please stop that. You're taking it to a personal level while I can have none of that(besides admins are way too keen to tame it down because someone wasn't being nice enough, so see I'm glad to discuss with you but let's keep it fair and clean)
Understand that in no way I'm offending you and if I did, I didn't mean to ok?

I'm not a native english speaker so please do not take my way of writing as if it might assert anything at all by itself(fluency of language might at best reveal more practice with it, any other conclusion you draw from it is none of my business. I'm not playing the smart alec here(if that's what you were accusing me of?), especially not in a language which is but foreign to me.)

Once again do not bring the discussion to a personal level. It was not I who said "I dislike people like you"(that sounds pretty much like an offense to me, much more that being called comrades lol), but as you see I didn't mind because we must not address each other's trifles here. We're supposed to be discussing on Lv topics right?

cheers
