I prefer water over tea or soda.  I also tend to nibble on pineapple chunks.  Also try to remain hydrated.  It takes a few hours for water you drink to rehydrate your cells, so plan ahead.  

And take a several-minute break every 20-30 minutes.  This is hard for me to do.  I have to set an annoying timer across the room to force me to pause the recording, get up, and turn off the timer.
