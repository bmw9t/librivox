Good morning, miss Cristine!

I have added two more pieces for prooflistening, which you - if interested in Russian history - may find quite fascinating: the story of the murder of Prince Dimitrij of Ouglech and the reign of Boris Godunov. St. Dimitrij's narrative is both eloquent and captivating!

Have you, by chance, any access to the unabridged Lives by Metropolitan Makarios? I have heard they were being reprinted in Germany.
