You read some sort of dedication or something before the main text. It's not on the Gutenberg version. 

There's a bit of noise right at the beginning of the recording that can probably just be cut out.

5:56 to end - there's a decided change of recording quality/sound compared to the rest of the recording.

There are some lip smacks throughout, such as at 5:47, but I don't think they're frequent or loud enough to warrant re-recording or editing.

All in all, I think the only thing that should be fixed is the noise at the beginning. The rest are up to your discretion.
