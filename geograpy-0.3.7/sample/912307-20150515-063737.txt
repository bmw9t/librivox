Wow Chloey, you really have it tough.

In a previous life, I used to be a Food Service Manager and I would teach these diets and how to eat properly whilst on them. Since this is 20 or so years ago, my current knowledge on the subject is dated.

Are you using rice flour? A friend of mine uses guar gum to glue it together and it works quite well.

Instead of apple pies, try an apple crisp made with the rice flour, brown sugar and (oops I see no butter- is there a substitute you can use? Margarine with non of the above no no's?) (Flieschman's made a good low sodium margarine)

What are your symptoms? I used to get terrible migraine headaches (Still do occasionally) and I found it was due to 2 main ingredients in foods - caramel food coloring (I can eat real caramel go figure) found in most dark soda drinks like pepsi and coke. And sodium nitrate - a preservative that sticks to fats in meat products. I could not eat bacon for years and have only recently reintroduced it back into my diet. I still do not drink pepsi, coke or rootbear.  

I hope you can sort it out.
