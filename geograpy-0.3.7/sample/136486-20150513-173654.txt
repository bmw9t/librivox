Thanks Tiffany, I really appreciate it!I’ve had some good runs of recording lately, so here are chapters 8 and 9. Just a note on Chapter 8: about halfway in, he is telling a story about someone faking insanity. He has just come off the back of telling another story about someone going crazy, and there is a point in the text where the names of the subjects of these two stories get mixed up. The first story is about Billy, and the next about Louis. Right at 15:00 or so he uses “Billy” twice where it SHOULD read “Louis.” I took the initiative and made the correction. Let me know what you think.Chapter 8:https://librivox.org/uploads/darvinia/autobiographyofathief_08_hapgood_128kb.mp3run time 30:31Chapter 9:https://librivox.org/uploads/darvinia/autobiographyofathief_09_hapgood_128kb.mp3run time 21:07-B
