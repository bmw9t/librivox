I'm just curious, since I find this whole Librivox site rather intriguing and like to know things; every day I see at the bottom of this page that quite a few people are "visiting" it.  What reason is there for people who aren't DPLing or MCing the project to visit?  Doesn't seem very scenic for anyone not directly involved.Just curious!  Thanks...  :o)
