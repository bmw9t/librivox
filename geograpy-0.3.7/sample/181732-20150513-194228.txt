I 'subscribe' to some topics that way by possting in them once, and it can be faster because the emails can take several hours to get to you I think I tried sort of everything to receive emails from my posts. There is somebody on librivox who actually wrote a program which will allow you to receive emails and I am trying it out at the moment. However, your message of 15 June did not get through to me either ... Sigh.As for reading more chapters. Yes, I would like to read 46 but do have a time issue at the moment. The children will be on holiday soon and I will not be able to start before week 32. If this ok with you, I will be more than happy.Have a good day.
