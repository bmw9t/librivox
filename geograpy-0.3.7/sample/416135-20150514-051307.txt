To All:This has been a great reading experience, a good book.  I hope to stay on board for Anne's non-fiction Trollope.  And I hope we well soon be doing another fiction piece.  But before we pack up and move away I wonder if I might attempt to gin up some interest for a book  that's been buried in the "suggestions" forum for some time -- Dostoevsky's The Possessed, or The Devils.  So far there is no audio recording of this book, which as translated by Constance Garnet, is in the public domain.  I would love to do some reading of this book, but I'm not quite ready for the BC/MC role as yet.  Any interest or suggestions would be most welcome.Bob
