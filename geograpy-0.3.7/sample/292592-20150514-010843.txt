I'll upload after those extra bits are added.Thanks, ToddAh - I found out where the intro/disclaimer/outro files were in an upload message by michaelreuss (not in MW).  Added them to chapter 30.  But before I upload that chapter: Question for BC, MC, or DPL - these files seem to use the short version of the disclaimer - what we'd use for a solo.  No "For more information or to volunteer...."  Is that okay?Thanks, Todd
