My favorites are Jane Austen solos - especially Elizabeth Klett's and Karen Savage's. I think they are both GREAT readers that could really get paid to read these things out loud. Also, I love Kristin's Milne mystery. It's an excellent reading as well.

And Jamie, thank you.  If I could but find more of those 19th c. women explorers I'd read them all.
