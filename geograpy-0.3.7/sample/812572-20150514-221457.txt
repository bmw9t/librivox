I hope this does turn into an important project, and to me one of the most interesting bits is the participation of volunteers: to get people reading, in some kind of community. there's something cool about that.

and, lets say the project is really successful and we put out, I don't know, 100 books by the end of 2006 (?) ... and it was cause regular joes & janes who like books, and who have crappy reading voices like me, said, ok i'll pitch in there!

I know my chapters are not very good. certainly we have a broad range of readers, but like kristen I find by reading a few chapters, and listening to some of the good readers (check gord's stuff, esp his frankenstein!), I try to pick up some tips, and it seems to be getting better. i hope!

anyway, i listened to chap 8 & it sounds great to me.

Hugh.
