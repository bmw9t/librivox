About a month and a half ago, I posted a message about recording plays for Librivox. I represent a community theater company and we're very excited about getting a group of actors together and recording a table read.

I am an experienced audio and video professional so technology isn't the issue. But for a trial run I'm thinking that it would be good to start with one-act plays instead of longer ones.

I found a compilation of public domain one-acts on Project Gutenberg and it would serve several purposes for us. First of all, we could do it in small pieces (there are 11 discrete plays). Second, there is a total of over 40 roles so we could get many people to participate.

My question is: Can we present these as separate projects or do we have to submit the entire book at once?
