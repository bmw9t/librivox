Hi Elli,Help - am a bit confused.    1.  I did do noise cleaning on all the recordings, and can't hear where there is interference.  Can you make some suggestions or point out where the problems are?2.  Also, in the MW, you mention ID3 tags.  Please clarify a bit.  However, I didn't fill in the chapter name as there isn't one - is this what you are referring to?Sally
