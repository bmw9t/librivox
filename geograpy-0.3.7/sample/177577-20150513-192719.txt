MW is up, if you have any problems please let me know.We can sit in Launch Pad for a bit to attract a DPL, post when you are ready for me to move this to "Going Solo".A couple of comments on the first post (the template generator hasn't been updated):1) file name should end in _128kb.mp3      Example filename beforeadam_##_london._128kb.mp3 (all lower-case) where ## is the section number (e.g. beforeadam_01_london_128kb.mp32) ID tags section is optional.  They are not mandatory during recording as they are easily applied during cataloging now.3) If you wish say .....    Since this is a solo feel free to edit these to what you plan to say, makes it easier for the DPL
