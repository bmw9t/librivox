Yeah, let's do a section that will be dramatis personae and prologue. So do that intro as you detailed above, but say "Dramatis personae and prologue." I'd skip the Stevenson quote since I suspect that was an editorial addition and not something of Shaw's.Also don't forget to give yourself a voice credit! Make sure there's a "narrated by Bookwyrm" in at least one of your files.
