Welcome Wendella! Great to have you with us!  I'll paste some links below that might help for when you're ready to start recording here.  Remember, people here are very helpful and friendly, so don't be afraid to ask any questions you have along the way. Here's the Newbie Guide to Recording:http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/Newbie_Guide_to_RecordingBut the first step will be to upload a 1-Minute Test Recording:http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/1-Minute_TestThis test is of course not for any kind of audition purposes, just to make sure it's okay technically. We just have to make sure that everyone is in the right format so that the end result can be handled in a uniform way, and that everyone sounds acceptable from a volume and noise point of view for the purposes of recording the Public Domain works. Once that's out of the way, you can dive into the projects listed on the threads and pick something (hopefully starting short and easy since the editing is what takes the most time!), or you can find something in the public domain ("PD") on your own and read that. So welcome, again, and have fun! Samanem  _________________
