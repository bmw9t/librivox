My point about youtube wasn't that this site needs to become like youtube. Since some people said that including a like button will cause people to stop making recordings here, I was only pointing out that:- On this site people use their voice, and on youtube people share their voice and in many cases their face as well.- Some people on youtube get paid for their videos, but a large majority don't (and in the past even few people used to), hence the majority of their videos are also volunteer made.- Youtube had ratings from the start, and now it has a like button, but it didn't stop people from making videos there.I also have a question. Since many people here are in favor of a 'thank you to readers' thread, how is that different from having a Like button (or Recommend) button on the page? Doesn't that mean there will be many books left out which are not thanked, and that will be hurtful to the people who recorded those books?
