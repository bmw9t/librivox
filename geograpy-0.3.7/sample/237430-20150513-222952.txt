Carolin/ElliI have a small conundrum. There is a character in the book called Augustus Moddle he features in chapter 32, chapter 33, and chapter 37. I pondered on how to pronounce his name, should it sound like "model" or "Moodle" so in chapter 32 I chose the latter and now begin to wonder if that pronunciation is correct. Purists may say that my interpretation is incorrect.I would appreciate your thoughts on this before I continue (you say tomato â€“ I say tomatoe)  RegardsPeter
