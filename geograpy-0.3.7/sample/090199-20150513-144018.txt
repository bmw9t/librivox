Much better!Next step will be noise cleaning. Here are a couple resources: text instructions: http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/Noisecleaning_With_Picsvideo: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFSg9o37HMwMy settings are as follows:Noise reduction: 12Sensitivity: 0Frequency Smoothing: 150Attack/decay: 0.03I tried them on your file, and I thought it cleaned up nicely. Try it and see what you think.It does drop the volume down a bit - some of the volume is from the  noise, after all - so you could amplify a little bit afterward. If you find you can't amplify enough, you could use compression. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJ3lOTDsN6cIt will squish your spikes so that you can amplify a bit more. My default settings are as follows:Threshold: try -17 dB Noise Floor: -40 dBRatio: 2.5:1Attack: 0.2Decay: 1.0NO checks in the check boxesAfter compression, amplify by 5 dB.Post your results here.
