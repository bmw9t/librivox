Sweet indeed, Patrick!Welcome to LibriVox--very happy to have you join us!  We ask that you submit a 1-Minute Test (not an audition, but a check for any problems with your technical specs, volume, and the like).  Better to solve any problems before tackling a lengthy recording.I would also point you to Phil's Very Helpful Videos.  They contain a wealth of information about how LibriVox works and about how to record using Audacity.Browse the forums, find some topics that are of interest to you.  We often recommend that newcomers start with a shorter recording--perhaps a submission to our Weekly Poetry or a shorter section in a group project--just to get a feel for the recording/editing process.  If you run into any problems or have a question, don't hesitate to ask.  There are lots of people here who will be happy to assist you!
