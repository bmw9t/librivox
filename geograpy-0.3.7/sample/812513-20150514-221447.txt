Something that helped me was something I learned in debate class.  If you're having trouble with slurring or diction you may find this helpful.  Take a pan and hold it horizontally between your teeth like a bit.  Read aloud (slowly) the piece/page with the pen in your mouth, trying to make each word clear.  This will get your mouth used to making the proper sounds with more effort, so that when you take the pen out and read the piece again, you'll make the right sounds with less effort.  *This is not a pretty thing to practice and you may drool a bit.
