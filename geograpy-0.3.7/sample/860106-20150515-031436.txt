Praise for ExEmGe (Andy Minter) via the 'Thank a reader' feature:

Quote:HiI just wanted to say thank you to Andy Minter for his readings of Arnold Bennet’s novels about “the five towns”—The Card, The Regent, and The Old Wives Tale. The voices he does for each character are so entertaining, and it was a great pleasure to be introduced to this author I had never read before. I searched out solo projects of Mr Minter’s after hearing him read several chapters of Anthony Trollope’s The Warden and enjoying them so much more than the rest of the book. I can’t wait to listen to more of Mr. Minter’s favorite books. Thank you, Mr. Minter!http://librivox.org/the-card-by-arnold-bennett/http://librivox.org/the-old-wives-tale- ... d-bennett/http://librivox.org/the-regent-by-arnold-bennett/Sarah V.
