grrrrr.

Thanks for the info, smijen. I know I named it properly (careful attention to the first post instructions for each field - honest!). But, but, after that I did go back and rename the filename to conform to this particular project, and after that I didn't recheck the tags, so apparently it overwrote the title field. grrrr. I promise to do better. This was supposed to be it.    Humble apologies smijen - nothing wrong with me that a couple of baby bunnies won't cure.
