There is a problem with the recording, though, but I didn't know how to fix it and wondered if you could help me figure out what the problem is. In several spots, the audio is chopped for a fraction of a second and it ends up cutting out a syllable or two of a word. An example of this is around 38:08 during the sentence "Lay down, Mamma." This occurs about 25 times during the entire recording. What can I do to fix this?https://librivox.org/uploads/philchenevert/ohenryprizestoriesof1921_04_various.mp3I am putting this into the MW for prooflistening.  I heard the problem you speak of at 38:37 but have no idea what may be causing it without further informaton on how you record and edit. Actually the one at that point is indeed very slight.   Sometimes not having sufficient memory can affect Audacity, especially if you are recording multiple tracks and piecing them together.I record in one take. If I mess something up, I wait 6 seconds before beginning the sentence again. At the end, I go back and simply delete all the sentences that I messed up and the 6-second gaps. I didn't do any cutting or pasting or moving things around, which I know could cause something like the problem I'm having, but since I don't do any of those things, I'm confused about why those split-seconds end up getting clipped and chopped.
