I've PL'ed  section 36  and there are some typos in the text:

At 3:07  when it was not so yellow, and sun burnt, and freckled with grease spots,   


At  32:21  and the more wide spread the operations of this infamous association are discovered to 
be.

At :34:17 who were implicated in these villanous transactions,

At 38:38   and it is fully time an example were made that would forever put a stop to such villany on their part.


Audio reading is PL OK!
