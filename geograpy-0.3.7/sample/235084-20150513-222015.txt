Hi Larry, another great recording!!! One little repeat to fix please. 23-Second Part, Chapter I, part 1a "If Vespucius had really made this marvellous voyage, he would have far outstripped all the navigators of his time, and would have fully deserved that his name should be given to the newly-discovered continent, whose coast-line he had explored for so great a distance. @13:22 But nothing is less certain, and Humboldt's opinion has hitherto appeared to the best writers to offer the largest amount of probability."Thank you!Forgot to mention VERY good job on the Spanish parts!
