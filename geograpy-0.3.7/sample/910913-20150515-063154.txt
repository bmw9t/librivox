Or maybe a bit in between?  I use whole wheat flour, (no sense in  paying more for less substance.) so maybe that had something to do with it.
Yeah, they're chewy/rubbery, and then you toast them so the faces get crispy (but I've never made them). I've never seen a wholemeal crumpet - I'm not really sure how well that would work.
