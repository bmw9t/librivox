Hi viator - If you post the URL for your section, I'd be glad to have a listen on Rowen's behalf.  If you no longer have a record of it, you could upload it again, and just copy the URL the uploader script returns to you into a post to this thread.  If you have trouble, just pm me.

Rowland:  I've downloaded your section to listen!
