Chapter 4 is PL okay!Chapter 5 has some background noise from the beginning of the file through about 10:50,  and there is a funny noise at 3:31.  It sounds like you had clipped out a mistake, but there is a little blip left from it.    I'll be thinking about how you can improve your reading, but I'm not the best person to ask.  I need to improve mine too!
