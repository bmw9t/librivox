If, however, section 37 is still open next January, I'll be happy to come back to it and record it for you   So sorry for the inconvenience...  What... But isn't it this year? Because if it isn't then this isn't PD for me either:PWayburn died in '42. So, his writings are still copyrighted until 70 years after his death - counting from the 1st of January 1943, which makes it PD in Europe from the 1st of January 2013. I think it is okay for you to coordinate the book - no downloading or reading allowed for you until next year. But as you are the BC, you can always claim and delay reading until then...  I doubt that the book will be finished this year, it's quite a long one with many sections...Just seeing Barry's reply... I don't mind waiting it out, but I don't want to prevent other people from recording sections here...
