Just a thought... we could have a total length instead of a total number of poems - for instance, if we took all poems until we reached 70 minutes or so, it would mean each collection would then fit nicely on a CD. I think the first collection happens to be just under 80 minutes total by happy chance...

Wouldn't you like to be able to see the librivox short poetry collections in a nice line of CDs?
