Keyboard short cuts are such a great thing!I'm almost ashamed to say that I didn't use short cuts at all when I first came here. Not even the delete key. I actually clicked the menu and then delete for every mistake. Which gives something you could almost call pain in the mouse hand after a while. Now pain might be a good motivator. It didn't motivate me to make less mistakes but definitely motivated me to learn about short cuts. Now I use Karlsson's autohotkey script. It's great! It took a little effort to learn it but it is absolutely worth it.For beginners it's good to know that space starts and stops the playback and that del removes the highlighted part. And maybe that Ctrl+r repeats the last effect, which is very useful when de-amplifying to loud spikes or breathing sounds. But I think you already have that in your tutorials.
