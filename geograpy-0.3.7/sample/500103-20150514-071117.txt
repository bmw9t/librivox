I'm shocked too! I thought I could lean back and enjoy doing nothing for at least... oh well... I leave the decision about combining chapters up to you, because you'd have to fix all the intros/outros to the other files. To me it doesn't make much of a difference... We'd probably have to change the ID3 tags, as I don't think all 3 titles would fit into one  - or at least, it would look very strange. You'd probably need more time to read the title tag than the section lasts...   Your call...
