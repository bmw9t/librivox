However, since this would be your first recording for Librivox, we suggest you do the 1-minute test ( http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/1-Minute_Test ), so we can make sure all the technical aspects are ok. Please post your test in the Listeners and Editors Wanted forum, for faster feedback.Also, before I can assign you the section, as specified in the first message, I need to know under what name/pseudonym you'd like to appear in the catalog. We can also link to a personal website/blog.Thanks again!
