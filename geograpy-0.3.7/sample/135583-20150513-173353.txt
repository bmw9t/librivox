May I just say something? If you leave out the morality of people taking over another persons country, which I know is a big ask,  the chances of them being able to find an Aboriginal who didn't want to be found were pretty low   . And there was no way the Aboriginals didn't know all about them coming well before they started. I'm not saying terrible things didn't happen on both sides - they did. Given the complete differences between 2 cultures , one having little or no personal property and the other totally based on owning things including rather stupid animals who were very easy to spear, and quite tasty, there were bound to be problems , but with some goodwill on both sides co-existence was sort of possible.Anne
