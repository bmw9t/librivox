Eden, Going back through the thread I found that 18 was submitted but not entered in the MW or PL'd. I had to change the file name but here it is if you could give it a listen.http://upload.librivox.org/share/uploads/mb/scarletpimpernel_18_orczy.mp3It is in Stereo and too quiet, but I can fix that if there are no other major problems. Thanks!
