Would it be ok if you reread the parts of any lines where Ralph is mentioned? If it's a long direction, there's no need to reread the whole thing: you could just read a word or two after Ralph's name so the reading style is consistent. Then I will edit it to fit with what you have already done. Again, I don't want to bother you to go in and edit around what you've already read: if you put the new readings at the end of the file, I'll know where they should go.Oh, also, when you read the prologue you didn't leave a gap between the first line and the second. Could you please redo that? The first line isn't really part of the prologue: it's just saying "Prologue: as it was pronounced before the queen", or however it is worded, and then the prologue actually starts on the next line. Sorry, I guess it's not that obvious.Ahh! Yes, I'll do that, no worries:)Relax, I'm a seasoned narrator, I know these things happen;)
