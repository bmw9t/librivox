I'm up for that, would definitely be a nice break from Thyselton Dyer's ever so exciting chapters!  Would we read a story each or try and find one with lots of character dialog? Or just break it up like we have been with Dyer's chapters (although I don't think that would work so well?)?

Also I think I should be able to make the 21st October.
