Hi Vince,

Bass voices always welcome in my books! As is a good sense of humour!

I'd recommend the Samson Q1U mic if you're looking to spend a little more, and looking to record quite a lot, or are a bit of a perfectionist! I bought it on LV users recommendation. Cheapest UK price I found was £31.99 plus £6 delivery from Digital Village - if you live near a store, get them to order it in, pick it up yourself and there's no delivery charge.

Hope you have fun whatever (and with whatever) you decide to record

Simon
