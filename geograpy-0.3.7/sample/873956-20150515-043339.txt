Just for the record -- I haven't listened to many whole novels yet, but I've certainly sampled plenty of the poems and short stories, and almost every single one he hated, I liked!  I loved the Euthyphro...  I don't know how a dialogue is supposed to be narrated, if not dramatically.     If ever anyone could make Socrates and his idiot interlocutor come to life...well.  This recording came as close as you could ever get.

(BTW, we need more Plato in our catalog.   )

And yeah, I thought his note about the sonnets was funny.  "These are very short sonnets" -- as opposed to what, those two famous sonnets by Homer?   

I also enjoyed his near-alarm at the fact that "Rebecca" was a British man!  Good lord, what sorts of names are these Britons giving their boy children?    Do not be fooled!
