Welcome Christine,

Now that was an intro; feel like we know you already.  

You will find this a fun and happy community with everyone being so helpful. You should start out by going here: http://librivox.org/wiki/moin.cgi/  and learning about volunteering at Librivox.  Great information there about proof listening, recording, etc.  Lots of projects here to volunteer for.
