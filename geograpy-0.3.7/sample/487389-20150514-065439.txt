Unless there is some reason to use a pseudonym, I don't mind having my real name in the catalogue.  Is there any such reason?Do I need to say, "Section 4 of Jane Austen's Juvenilia.  This is a LibriVox ... Jane Austen’s Juvenilia, Lesley Castle, Part 1 (Introduction and Letters 1-3)," or can I leave out the second "Jane Austen's Juvenilia?"Thanks again,Bryan Peterson

Sorry Glor, Could I answer this question to you?
Dear Bryan, you could have your answer if you take a look at the first part of any of the projects.
I may paste it down here, for you easier to have a look at
