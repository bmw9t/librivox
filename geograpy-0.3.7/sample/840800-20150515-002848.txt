I'm thinking it's pretty much like the end of "Montmagny", which is a placename I hear once in a while, so I should be good to go.

Thanks for the mp3 file too.

I almost backed out of this one, seeing the lists of names that I had not heard before, but I figure I can simply "say them with authority" and claim that they're pronounced  according to an obscure Acadian regional sub-dialect. (Unless the listener is familiar with Acadian French, in which case I'm hosed.  ) I can't do worse than your typical Anglo hockey play-by-play announcer.
