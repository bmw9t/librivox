This book is a classic.  Its title is "Elizabeth Gilbert and Her Work for the Blind".  It was written by Frances Martin, and published by MacMillan and Co. in London and in New York in 1887.  The book was about the lifework of a lady named, Elizabeth Gilbert, herself blind, who dedicated her life to help the poor blind people in England. Given the year of publication in 1887, I believe this book is definitely in public domain now and no longer subject to copyright.  I strongly suggest this book. It was written so well and so beautifully.
