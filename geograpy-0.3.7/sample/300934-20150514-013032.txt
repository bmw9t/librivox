Thanks, Phil!  I'm glad I am catching on to that skill.  I have uploaded the newly edited track (the cut and splice and most of the clicks removed, hopefully).  I listened to the track at the other time reference you gave me and, I confess, I was not able to locate what you mentioned.  Perhaps it is because I am used to my own voice and am not picking up on the sound of the word as you are hearing it: http://upload.librivox.org/share/uploads/phi/newadventuresofalice_10_rae.mp3At any rate, you know I will do whatever I can to make this a quality recording.I look forward to both your's and Britannia's thoughts.Take care,Greg
