I've been a listener to a good number of the completed books for a while now; I enjoy loading up my iPod and taking Jane Austen or the like with me as much as possible. So I figured, at some point I should think about giving back to a resource that has offered so much to me.

So here I am.  I am excited to give it a whirl, however I'm a bit concerned about time and such.... not to mention dogs barking and phones ringing and all those annoying things that would interfere in a recording. ::smirk::
