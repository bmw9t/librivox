Wow Mike I am getting behind but I just had to do some recording myself.    The kids are home now so good time to proof listen. Though I am working on cataloging another book that is one chapter away from completion. I can set most of it up and then just dump the last file in.

Yes I am enjoying it. As I said before, your voice is perfect. I love that this is written by an American in England/France. Your accents are perfectly horrible.     Just how I would imagine an American would do them. I know a Canadian would probably be better at the French since we are supposed to be a Bilingual country!
