Welcome to LibriVox, hearhis!    The sections are yours!  This is an old project long overdue for completion, and we hope to have it cataloged by December 1.  I hope you can work with us in that time frame.  If real life intervenes, there is no shame in turning your chapters back in!

Caet and I are planning to start Decline and Fall Vol V as soon as clean-up month is over, so there will be plenty of new chapters available then.

Thank you for volunteering.
