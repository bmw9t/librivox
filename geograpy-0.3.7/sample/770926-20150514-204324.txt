You're fine with 30b. I'll be adding a letter to mine.

Now about your chapter. I just read it, as I've nearly completed mine. TetoYasha was quite right. It's interesting to see how the medium of our final chapters are so different. (Mine is in the form of a long blog entry.)

You've done an excellent job, Michael. I'm particularly happy with how you've continue to make a special effort to weave in and elucidate on precious chapters. The clarifications and expositions have tightened the novel as a whole. Thanks. AND, very interesting story lines in your 30 as well. Very good.

Well, off to finally record Chapter 29.

And then it's tweaking what my three classes came up with these past two days. All three are more summaries than anything else. Very short. But at least they did something. Excellent lively brainstorming sessions. (And yes, more teen-age Martians and "Aliens.") Too much movie going if you ask me! Monday we record the class versions. And, praise be to you-know-who, Tuesday it's back to Oedipus Rex. As my kids say, "Hey, Mr., what could be better than killing your father and sleeping with your mother?"

What is this new generation coming to?
