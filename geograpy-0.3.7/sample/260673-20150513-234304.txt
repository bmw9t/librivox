I took your advice and posted 07 The Legend as a single piece (just over an hour). A wonderful satire of intellectual pretentiousness; change a few names and we're right in 2013.I'm a bit disappointed not to have met any ghosts yet, but I believe the supernatural is about to appear in the next chapter.
