Hello, and welcome to LibrivoxThank you for your interest in this project. However, since this would be your first recording for Librivox, we suggest you do the 1-minute test ( http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/1-Minute_Test ), so we can make sure all the technical aspects are ok.Also, I usually do not assign more than one section to new contributors - that's just because many times people don't evaluate properly the time and effort needed to record one section. So I will assign you section 04; once it is recorded, you can claim other sections.Thanks again for your help!
