HiWelcome to Librivox . I can't MC your project or even check that the text you are using is PD - it isn't PD for me . But I would strongly suggest that while you are waiting for someone who can to come along you do a sound check http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/1-Minute_Test . It is sad enough when a chapter has to be rejected because it has problems that make it unusable that could have been easily fixed . A whole book would be very very sad.Anne
