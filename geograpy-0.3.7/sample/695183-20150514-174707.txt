I'll direct Steampunk and thistlechick to your posts, in case they're not watching this thread any longer.  

But the things you mentioned were minor enough, in my opinion, that we could let them slip.  We generally aim for the same accuracy as Project Gutenberg, 99%, so a few deviations from the text here and there is fine.  But I'll leave it up to them to decide.  Thanks again Alana!
