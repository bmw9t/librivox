File specs are all correct .The volume is a little too low, Tinflab. Try increasing the microphone volume just a little in Audacity (slider control to the right of the microphone icon at the top of the screen) or in your computer's control panel so that the wave form looks more like this (ignore red lines):You can check your own volume with our Checker program - see info at http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/Checker Make sure you download the 0.95 version - you will find the volume in decibels on the Information tab. For your information, we look for around 89 dB, and your current test measures about 84.8 dB. You have a number of plosives (popping on consonants like p , th and t),, which are caused by incorrect positioning of your mic. You need to speak slightly past the mic, rather than straight at it.  Move the mic slightly left or right if a desktop mic, or slightly up or down if a headset. If you put your finger in front of the mic, and say puh-puh forcefully, you shouldn't feel the puff of breath if the mic is in the right place.There is some background noise. It will be easier for me to advise on what to do with that once your input volume is a little higher. Please do another test, and post here when you are ready. Please include your forum name in the filename so that it doesn't get confused with someone else's - we have a lot of test recordings to check at the moment .Ruth
