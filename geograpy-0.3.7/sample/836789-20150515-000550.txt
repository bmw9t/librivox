Quote:I'm trying to download "Anne's House of Dreams" by Lucy Maud Montgomery, but it gives me this error now matter which way I try to download it (zip file or any of the chapter ways):The specified item cannot be found or its XML is unparseable...Feel free to report this so that we can fix the problem. I will continue to try it in case you're able to fix it.  Right now I will try to listen to the book that is not completed yet.  Hopefully you are able to fix the completed book or the 2nd book will be completed soon.  I really enjoy listening to the books.
