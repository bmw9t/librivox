Hi, my name is Hans-Christian. I have read all my life, and I was about to read my favourite books to Youtube to develop my reading skills, when I discovered LibriVox. LibriVox is a noble cause, that I would like to contribute my time and effort to.I grew up close to to the Rhine between Cologne and Bonn in Germany. I spent half a school-year in Maryland close to Washington D.C. and am now living in Rostock at the Baltic Sea working as a waiter. I would like to grow closer to the community of supporters that seem to have similar interests to mine. Hence I am pleased to greet youYours truly Birke ^^
