Hugh will have to answer your gutenberg/librivox questions, but I've got to thank you for mentioning War of the Worlds!  I think we're going to try to get some of our current projects done and then start up some of these great book suggestions. 

I adore a German accent.  How would you like to read one of the little Beatrix Potter stories over in Readers Wanted? :)
