Here's something that may work: http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1633.  "The Brick Moon and Other Stories by Edward Everett Hale".  One of the stories is "99 Linwood Street," though the actual title at the front of the story shows up as "9 Linwood Street."  Anyway, it may help fill out the collection.
