Hi there, JonathanI will MC this one for you, be right back with the window and all that. Edit: Ok, window in place, this projet is in the database. Just a few comments:- I have changed your naming scheme for a simpler one: peaceofmind_x_seneca, where x is the section number. Since there will be only 4 sections, we don't even need the 0 in the beginning.- Who is the author of the introduction? It says on the top of the first post: "How to maintain a tranquil mind amongst social upheaval and turmoil, addressed to Serenus (Introduction by xxxx)". We need to know who xxxx is. - I took a look at your other project, it seems that you haven't been using the magic window. If you have a username and password for the window in that project, the same one will work here. If you don't, just let me know and I can send them to you in a private message.I will let this thread here in the Launchpad while the window gets filled in, maybe we can find a proof-listener.
