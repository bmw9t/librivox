"Refusing to listen" and "preferring to listen" don't seem like they'd meet our "Anyone can read anything" aim ... we're here to allow people to make recordings.  And I know the feeling about the grammar, 'cos I have that trouble with broad Scottish -- Auld Lang syne doesn't exactly trip off the tongue, even though it is in English.  Not the same as a recording being in Scots Gaelic, though.
