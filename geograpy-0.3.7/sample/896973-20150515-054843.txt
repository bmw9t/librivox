Verily I tried,but they could not be beguiled.There they were and they so pried,treating me as though a mad child. Again, and again,they tried to reconcile.Yet I would not fall his campaign,he was a tricky one this aedile. Though the worst was the agelast,with his aweful mastication.Oh, what a foreboding frown,just the vis-a-vis of a clown. He was quite keen,yes and oh so mean!He had brought his whip,strange pennate iron-tipped! It flew through the air,as if not a care;and pierced flesh,pain seering through my veins.And it was then, my will was at its bitter end.Through meticilous drain,they had won over my brain. It was then he shared the name,the wanted; Gregory Mccane.Incredulity swept to his face,what forlorn grace!Any feedback is much appreciated
