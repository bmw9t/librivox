Hello, people of the internet. My name is Meena (مينا in Arabic).I'm an 18-year-old who loves food, books, languages, winter and listening to awesome music. I just thought I would join this community and volunteer to do audiobooks in Arabic since it's my mother tongue.I am currently in the process of learning the French language, but because of my impatient nature, I am trying (unsuccessfully) to learn one more language - and that is Hebrew.Anyway. Hope everyone is having a fantastic day!
