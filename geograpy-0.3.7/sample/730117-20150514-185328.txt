Just uploaded chapters 44, 45 and 46.  Didn't mean to hold out on you.  Just forgot to upload as I finished them.

I gave your FTP site info (just to Deronda of course) to a friend who was eager to download and listen to them.  Hope you don't mind.  Just one lil friend.

Hope you are well.  All OK here - knitting, knitting, getting ready for Christmas.

Regards,

Becky
