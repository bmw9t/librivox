I guess I am too technically retarded to do this.  I uploaded to KM-kimerline like I thought I was supposed to.  Then I get this link that tells me absolutely nothing other than other people are being studious.    

I have mine done and I thought that I uploaded them.  Wasn't quite sure if chapter 16 went through but I didn't hear anything so I guessed I was okay.

I'm sure that I labeled them wrong.  I need someone actually talking me through things rather than reading a bunch of monochromatic mumbo jumbo. 

Well, I tried.
