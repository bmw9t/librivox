Hi icequeen,Here are sections 15 and 16:http://upload.librivox.org/share/uploads/arb/oldgreekstories_15_baldwin.mp3Duration - 13:14http://upload.librivox.org/share/uploads/arb/oldgreekstories_16_baldwin.mp3Duration - 20:26Section 15 is not absolutely word perfect but since you are asking for standard PL, I did not fix the two places where they vary slightly from the text. They do not change the meaning nor do they call attention to themselves. I hope this is all right and I hope you like the recordings.Bob
