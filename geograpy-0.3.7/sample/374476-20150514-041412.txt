Here is the Narrator, at 06:07I hope I got the names right, and I added this at the start, as well as the characters, didn't know if you wanted it or not: The scene is laid in Corinth. The play was first acted when Pythodôrus was Archon, Olympiad 87, year 1 (B.C. 431). Euphorion was first, Sophocles second, Euripides third, with Medea, Philoctêtes, Dictys, and the Harvesters, a Satyr-play.http://upload.librivox.org/share/uploads/ek/medea_narrator.mp3
