Hi Don,The tone of your voice is fantastic and the intonation as well. (I could listen to it for hours and actually, I will do that as DPLer   ) Nevertheless, there are some minor PL notes for section 1.The first two notes are also changeable by Leni on the server but since there are three edits necessary you can take care of them.File name: is aeneidis_01_01_maro.mp3, should be aeneidis_01_maro.mp3ID3 tag for the title: 01 - 01 - Aeneid, should be  01 – AeneidRepeat at 03:18 'Nec dum etiam causae irarum saevique dolores'.'nunc placida compostus pace quiescit' missing at 26:46.A stumble icluding your 'error' mark from 36:42 – 36:45.Greetings Kajo
