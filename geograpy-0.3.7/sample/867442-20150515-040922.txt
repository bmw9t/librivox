Agreed.  However, is there a way to search or browse this site by word count?  I've looked, but not found one.

For books already on the LibriVox site, "Total running time" is stated, which is great, and eliminates the need to estimate it based on word count.  

Unfortunately, I can't find a way to display all of the books on this site, ranked by run time or word count, or to filter the list to find all with a run time over, say, 5 hours.  Is there a way to do that which I'm missing?
