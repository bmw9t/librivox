As for the poem by Ronsard, if we take the trouble to get a French-speaking volunteer to read it into the record as printed, the only listeners who understand it will be those who would be much better off going to this address:STENDHAL – La Chartreuse de Parme | Litterature audio.comwww.litteratureaudio.com/...audio.../stendhal-la-chartreuse-de-parme.ht...‎Jul 22, 2009 – Téléchargez gratuitement le livre audio : STENDHAL – La Chartreuse de Parme. Format MP3an excellent free recording of the original book. With some sincerity, I think it would just be an annoyance to listeners looking for an English version of the book. (You will have perceived that I am a Stendhal fanatic, and believe the trouble of learning French is just about repaid by the pleasure of reading that book in the original.)We are allowed to add "For further information or to volunteer..." to the text. What about a humble statement that there is a poem at this point, first printed in Shakespeare's lifetime, which asserts that God kindly writes the future in the stars, but Man is too sinful to read them. If book reviews are privileged, sober and factual observations -- on a par with saying that a book contains 522 pages -- one is puzzled.To put off thinking about the real problems, I ask myself whether Librivox ever allows itself to say something like "The next five pages of this book are a table of planetary motions, which the author inserts to impress his readers with the strain on his hero's eyes. But we will omit them." I will work on the real problems tomorrow.
