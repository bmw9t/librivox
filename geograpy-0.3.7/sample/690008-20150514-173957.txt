Chris the edits that have been done for Section 17 have got a echo to them, can you check them out and see if they can be fixed, a couple of them are only short.

Here are the times: 06.47, 08.39, 08.55, 13.09 (quite a long one) 19.55, 25.10, 27.51, 28.20.

Sorry about doing this to you, really enjoyed the book and your reading was great.

Leave it with you Chris and will wait to hear back from you.

BTW. Section 18 Perfect.
