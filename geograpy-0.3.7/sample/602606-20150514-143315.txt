Hello all,
I listened to all of the sections 
Notice to the Second Edition 
Was almost unaudible to me. If someone can make it louder, I would listen to it again.
Notice to the First Edition 
Some distracting backround noise. Other than that, it's ok.
Section 8- a little to loud, please make it more quiet. Other than that, it is very good. 
Section 16-  A little to quiet. Other than that, it is very nice. Other than that, it is ok.
Section 21- ok.

Section 26: ok. Some say it's a little to quiet, see what you think.

Section 44- ok.
Section 46- very nice.
