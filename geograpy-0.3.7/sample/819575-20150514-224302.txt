Yes, Catherine!  We have a thread called "Thankyous for LibriVox in general" and that would be a lovely place for that kind of post.Phil wrote:But the search by narrator is uh ... quirky. I was waiting in a doctor's office just yesterday and wanted to check out the volume on something I had recorded last month so I did a search for my name and got a list of 133 'things' I had done. Now I know I've recorded over 700 sections (what we call chapters) so where were they? why did it return books that I had not recorded anything in?Unless you only ever contribute one section to a project, Phil, your 'things' count will always be rather lower than your sections count.  And in fact it's too late now anyway, since you've done a number of solos and can't "minus" anything to even the scores.   Which books did your search include that you've not contributed to?  That shouldn't happen, although sometimes there is oddness within collections.
