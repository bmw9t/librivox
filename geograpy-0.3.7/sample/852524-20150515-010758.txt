I can recall some Polish staff picks being included after my suggestions, although, yeah, mostly they seem to be in English. Also, maybe you could use Masa's list (or some other source) and put the number of works-in-languages-other-than-English somewhere in a visible place on the page, so that non-English speakers who visit us can easily see it. Yeah, I know there's supposed to be a fuctionality like this in the advanced search, but it's known to be glitchy.
