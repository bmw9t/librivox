The poem came from Bartleby, http://www.bartleby.com/118/10.html

After GarageBand sends its exported AIFF file to iTunes and iTunes is open, with the file automatically selected (and playing.) Press the space bar to stop playing it. Press OPTION-i and fix the TAGS in the window that opens up. Then close the window to do your conversion to MP3. (iTunes calles the conversion an import. Nutty, huh?)

Write again if you need further help, please.)
