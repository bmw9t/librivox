 In other projects I MC where the BC doesn't have server space, we've followed this process, which has proved quite efficient: 
Please upload all files to my Uploader http://librivox.gesine.org/   (please read the info on that page)Password upl0ad1t(or readers upload there directly)I receive an email whenever something arrives in my Uploader. I then grab the files and move them to the project folder on my server (in this case, http://librivox.gesine.org/upload/leviathan/).When it's there, I put the Listen link into the reader list of your project (and mark the section 'complete' if you haven't already done so). I will post a quick message in the thread when I've done this.Then you can go to the folder and check that the file has uploaded correctly, by comparing the filesize. If everything is fine, the section is available and already set up for the proof-listening stage.
Does this make sense? Let me know if you have any questions.
