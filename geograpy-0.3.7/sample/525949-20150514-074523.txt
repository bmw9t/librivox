I have done most of it already as listed in pink, and I've figured out the the remaining edgings and collars although I haven't test knit them yet. 

Plus I've done the miser's purse, worked out the stitch pattern for the infant's jacket, shell tidy, and "mitten with a row of hearts down the back". And I'm pretty sure I've worked out the gauge for the arrow pattern skirt. So in essence, it's "almost" done. But it's been almost done for four years and I started it about 10 years ago.

A word of warning for the reading though. It does have a toiletries and crochet section as well
