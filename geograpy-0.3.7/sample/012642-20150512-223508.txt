Welcome to LibriVox NIKOWRITER  The place to start is the Newbie Guide to Recording, which tells you how to set up your computer to record. Of course, you may want to start out with Proof Listening. This will give you a better idea of how things get done here. Once you've done that, I strongly recommend doing a short test recording in the Listeners & Editors Wanted section of the forums. This is NOT an audition, but a way to check to make sure all your technical settings are correct, your volume loud enough, etc.Some neat video guides are available here: http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/User:PhilchenevertOne thing to be aware of, is that our recordings are all of Public Domain texts, and are all released as Public Domain recordings, which means that our end product is free for anyone to use for any purpose, even for repackaging and selling if they so choose. But it fits with the core mission of Librivox, so that's what we do. This doesn't sit well with some voice actors and others, so I thought I should mention it. http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/Copyright_and_Public_DomainHave fun!Esther
