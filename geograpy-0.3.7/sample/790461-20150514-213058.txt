I just uploaded the preface/author's note to my server.  

http://librivox.wwc.edu/oz/marvelous_land_of_oz/marvelous_land_of_oz_00_baum.mp3

I also changed all the Mp3 tags slightly.  The Comments field is the same on all of them as the preface.  If you could change the ones you've already downloaded to match the tags of the preface I'd appreciate it, but if you don't want to take the time that's fine to.

How this for an introduction/summary...

Quote:The Marvelous Land of Oz is the second of the Oz books.  It follows the adventures of the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman and Tip.The Emerald City has been taken over by the Army of Revolt, and our adventurous friends need the help of Glinda the Good to return it to its rightful ruler.

As for the name and url listed with it, just put my name (Paul Harvey) and use my librivox wiki url (http://librivox.org/wiki/moin.cgi/harvpa). 

Takes too much time to maintain a "real" website... 

Thanks!
