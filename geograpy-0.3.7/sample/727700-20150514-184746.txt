I'll leave it as it is (for now, at least), Euthymius. 

I'm wondering how we could standardize the title's names so that people searching the catalogue always have them appearing one after the other. A bit like what we have for the Bible's books. They appear one after the other as the title begins with "Bible (version) O/NT ##", including the number of the book in the title, after the common section of the title. 

Would something like "Житія Святыхъ ## на мѣсяцъ [month]" and "Zitija svjatyh ## na mesjac  [month]" work (## being the volume's number) to standardize the titles?
