(normally (pi)r^2=A, but if you knew what 'A' is and wanted to find the radius and consequently the diameter you would do this: r=sqrt(A/pi)  ) useful for finding the distance as the heat proof mole burrows, from two points opposite each other on the earth although this would actually be: Diameter=2(cuberoot(3piV/4) because it is a 3D figure.

Precise square roots are also needed when graphing a quadratic equation of the form: Y=AX^2+BX+C which is used for trajectory.
Please correct me if I'm wrong on any of this, I'm still learning.
