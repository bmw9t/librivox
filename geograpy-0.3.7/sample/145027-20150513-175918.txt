I already did the noise reduction. I know im not very good yet.    and if it real bad just say so. Thanx.P.S. I cant seem to access the the original post unless I am signed out.  I have checked your volume.  It is 90.2 dB, which is right in the range that we are looking for.  Don't worry about whether you are good or not!  When you don't worry about how you sound so much, then you will get even better.  And, your first recording is not bad, or horrible, or terrible, or any other yucky word.  It is just fine, great job for your first try!  Now, edit this one and upload it for us so we can include you in this project!  Make sure to use zauberlinda_13_gibson_128kb  for the file name.
