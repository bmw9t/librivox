Thanks, Cori & Caet.  Just to let you know, I'm letting this stay in "Readers Found" because Graham (AGsec) would like to read these chapters, and will sign up for them as his schedule permits.  And feel free to check on my "sheparding" in the magic window under "sort by reader".  I have devised my own "system" but suggestions are welcome.
