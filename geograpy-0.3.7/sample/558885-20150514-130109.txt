Chapter 8 is uploaded.

I know, all GOOD little boys and girls should be in BED on Christmas Eve!  But, after we put the kid to sleep, I wandered back into the office and finished editing chapter 8.

My kitten, Anabell, has insisted on "helping" with both Chapter 7 and Chapter 8.  

She sleeps on the desk while I read, or on my lap or shoulder.  MOST of the time she stayed quiet.  I think I managed to catch and edit out all of the purrs and collar clinks, and the times she decided that the microphone would make a great cat toy.  BUT, if you find any really bad cat noises left in, please let me know.  

Merry Christmas!
