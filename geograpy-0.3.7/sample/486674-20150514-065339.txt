I listened to Rick Rodstrom's reading of the Elf and the Rose. Not an official listener, but...1) you have a great voice, you really differentiate the characters, quite impressive2) good pacing and steady volume3) you breathe into the mike a few times at the beginning of the recording but this seems less prominent further in the recording. Still, something to watch out for.
