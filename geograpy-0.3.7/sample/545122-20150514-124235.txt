You may use the name "skeptyk" for the catalogue.  (My name is Jeanne E. Hand-Boniakowski.)  

I will be making the test recording this week, after my beloved noisy visitors leave.  

Although I will use the facsimile file as directed for the actual recording, I am going to be checking out the pdf of this book which I transferred to my Kindle last month, curious to see how accurately these were transferred. I found my download at Project Gutenberg where someone had already mobi'd it. Are you using facsimiles often?
