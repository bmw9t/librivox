Pirate Stuff:

Talk Like a Pirate Day was yesterday, of course, and NPR had a couple of related features.  In the morning, they had a story called "Arrrrr! It's Talk Like a Pirate Day!".  Original, huh?  They did have one nifty visual on the website, a chart proving that a lack of pirates is directly respponsible for global warming.  Here's a link to the webpage (and you can listen to the story there too).

During the afternoon, they had a story about a new CD, entitled "Rogue's Gallery: Pirate Ballads, Sea Songs, and Chanteys".  Here's a link to the story.  There are also links to four of the songs from the CD, including very nice renditions of "Mingulay Boat Song" by Richard Thompson (of Fairport Convention), and "Blood Red Roses" by Sting (of . . . well, Sting lately).
