Quote:But using other sample rates than 44.1 kHz is better suited to voice recording, isn't it?There has been a lot of discussion, since there are tempting reasons to use other sample rates. Therefore the complete official version is the following:44.1 kHz is the default sample rate in lots of software. We need to get files at this rate because this is what our host, archive.org, uses for its flash playerPlease don't use any rate other than 44,100 Hz. If you accidentally send us something at these rates, our catalogers will resample it for you and advise you on how to record at a sample rate we can use. Don't worry, your work will never be wasted!
