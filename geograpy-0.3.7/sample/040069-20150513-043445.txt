Not the most shocking news, I know. Greetings!  This is an introduction thread, so I'll just get down to it.  I'm an actor living in Seattle, WA USA.  I was given a link to the LibriVox website by a friend of mine who is active in BookPals.  This looked to be right up my alley, and fun to boot.  So, I thought I'd give it a whirl.

Cheers!
