Indeed, comparing this with your previous recording, there is a difference. Whether the difference makes it sound better or not is a matter of preference! I liked them both  This one has a softer voice, softer volume 90dB and a slight non-disturbing residual background noise, the previous one has a more bass voice, higher volume 92dB, maybe more aggressive noise removal (or maybe the environment was less noisy at the time of recording).
