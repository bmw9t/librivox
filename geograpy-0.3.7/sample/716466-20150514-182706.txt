hi TTM and Kehinde

here is the edited version of Chapter 13.  
http://upload.librivox.org/share/upload ... entley.mp3

a minor clarification, the text has the sentence as below

"I so much want all that horror buriedâ€”buried deep. 


i guess there should be a longer pause between the 2 "buried"s. I've done that, added a longer pause between the two. 

i hope this is ok. otherwise let me know what to do.

thanks
