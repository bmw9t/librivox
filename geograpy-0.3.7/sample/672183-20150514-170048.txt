Scott,

That would be terrific.  I'll sign you up for 18 & 19. 

M. is indeed usually an abbreviation for Monsieur.  As you say it is an easy edit, but I'll leave it up to you if you want to change it or not.  Also as far as pronunciation of the various names, just go with your best guess unless you want to post either here or in Help Needed for some help from a French speaking volunteer.  My French is far from great - it's been years since that last French class and my accent was never very good even then!  As a rule of thumb, like Project Gutenberg, we try for ~99% accuracy (which equates to 12 s in a 20 min recording) so a minor mistake here or there is no big deal.
