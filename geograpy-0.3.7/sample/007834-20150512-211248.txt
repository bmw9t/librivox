Hi there! It's me Vikalp   I'm from the valleys of satpura in central India. I found this fantastic website while stumbling upon. I'm fascinated by the concept to record the books and share it to the world and anyone could listen your voice in any corner of the globe.   (ITS the best part).Presently I'm a student , and would love to volunteer as a recorder. Hindi (which is spoken in India) is my mother tongue although I can speak English too. So anyone who needs some passages in Hindi could feel free to shoot a reply.Poems and short stories are always welcomed in english  I;m a big fan of mystery novels (I just finished the audiobook of thirty-nine steps  ) . I like painting and photography the most. they are my hobbies. Anyone interested in seeing some images of india can click on my flickr photosteam link. http://www.flickr.com/photos/vikalpkumarOkay friends nice to meet you all!Warm Regards Vikalp
