LibriVox Short Poetry Collection 137All audio files for this collection can be found in the catalog: https://librivox.org/short-poetry-collection-137-by-various/This is an open collection of poems for the month of October 2014. When this month is over, another one will be started. Don't despair if the sections are all filled up! I will add more sections as needed. How to record a poem - Initial Guidelines:• All poems read must be in the public domain (that is, not copyrighted).• You do not have to "sign-up" to submit a poem; as long as it's clearly in the public domain, just start recording!• There is a limit of 3 poems per person per collection.• Poems can be as short as you like, but not longer than 30 minutes (approximately 5000 words). (If you would like to record a longer poem, please discuss it with the MC.)• To see what's been recorded already, you can search the LibriVox Catalog - but remember that we welcome multiple versions! Find a public domain poem:• The Poets' Corner is a great resource for public domain poetry.  Other sources to try are Bartleby and Project Gutenberg.• You may use other websites if you like, but we will have to check them to make sure they are not copyrighted.• Please read from the text you post! You may not read from another source, as the other source may not be public domain!• See this page
