Third Day, Part 1 PL notes:@29:21 extra "your" should be removed. Correct line is: Are swords afraid of clubs?@30:51 there is loud click, probably an editing error, as Mary says "It is as true"@33:32 "In the Queen's Name" should be only the two heralds, not the whole crowd and definitely not Simon Renard twice. Also at 35:22.@36:37 there is a missing "crowd" cry of "Death to Fabiani! Fabiani!"The crowd scenes are really good - I just can't help noticing that it is an "all female" crowd. It sounds odd. How about I quickly record the crowd lines with my "male voice processing" on it, just to give it a bit of bass? Since you'll be editing it anyway.
