I always like to hear that hyper-British pronunciation of French words (e.g. 'ballet' with stress on the first syllable), though it may not have been established yet when Urquhart did the translation.  Pronouncing the words French-like if you know what you're doing is quite proper, but anglicizing them gives a shape to the reading that I also enjoy.  Carl is right, though, err on the Anglo side.  Given the names of a lot of places in the text come from a much older version of French, their pronunciation may not be intuitive for a modern French speaker.

Cheers,
Maja
