I did all the fixes for section 13 and uploaded it, but when I went to put it in the MW the url had a 12 in it not a 13, was it like that before? Cause I did not touch the filename. But I checked and it was the unedited file. I am not sure if you have to do something for the proper section 12 because of that, but I will try to upload it again tomorrow and see if it works this time
