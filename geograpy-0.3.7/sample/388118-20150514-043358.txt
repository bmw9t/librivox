Ok here's the fixed chapter 2: http://upload.librivox.org/share/uploads/ni/howtolistentomusic_02_krehbiel.mp3 - 25:04So glad you caught that!!!!By the way, I forgot to mention that in Chapter 8, there were several musical examples with lyrics.  It sounded best to me when I read the lyrics, then pasted in the musical example.  Didn't make as much sense when I didn't read the lyrics.  And someone reading the book visually would have been able to read the lyrics, so it seemed best to include them.  Hope that's ok :)
