Gosh, I was hoping at least one of you would get scared. 

Kudos, to you, too.  I see "Riders of the Purple Sage" just made it to the catalog.  It's downloading now.  I'll listen while I garden a little this afternoon.  The weather did a 180 here this weekend - sunny and nearly 70 today.

Between Lincoln and Burgess with a little bit of Shakespeare thrown in, I've been racking up the sections lately.  With the three solo projects, along with Animal Book and Bird Book, Burgess accounts for close to half of my 56.  I'd like to get at least 70 by the end of the summer.  After that I'll be too busy with theatre for several months to do much recording.  I'll get working on Henry IV, Part 2 this week and then start on Reddy Fox, and maybe BC another Lincoln project.
