Oh my gosh! I'm Ms. Late-on-Everything! Heavens to Betsie, I sure didn't mean to put any pressure on folks. 

I was actually trying to say, Whew! I'm not going to worry about rushing with the noise cleaning, because a few of us still don't . . . hmm, I wonder if this is sounding worse and worse the more I explain?

Anyway . . . please believe me, I'm not trying to rush anybody, no sir. And frankly, someplace about October 10 would suit me fine.
