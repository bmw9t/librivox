Hi Neeru,

I just went to freeclassicimages.com and my virus scanner went completely berserk. I hope you are aware of the dangers coming from that website.

And sorry for not being accurate. The source of a picture is not the website, but the painter. For the next time, could you please add the name of the painter? And when you use the original illustrations, please add something like cover art taken from original publication, artist: [name] or cover art taken from original publication, artist unknown. And of course add cover design by Neeru. 

I hope you will make many more covers. We can do with a few extra artists here!

Bart
