Section 2 is PL OK!Thank you for the kind words, Dave! I'm glad you enjoyed the recording. It always is encouragement to know that people are listening and appreciating! I also recorded a third book by the same author on the Cure of Ars called "The Man Who Fought the Devil". I have other books by her that I plan to record at some point as well, including a book on Brother Joseph Dutton, who helped Father Damien on Molokai, and a series of books on the Revolutionary War - with Catholics as the main characters. She also wrote some smaller/easier saint books for children. Now you've got me thinking.....    (It's just that there are "So Many Books....So Little Time! )
