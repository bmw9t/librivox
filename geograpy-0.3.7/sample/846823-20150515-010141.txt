Praise for  sjmarky (Mark Nelson) via the 'Thank a reader' feature:Quote:If you would, please pass on our thanks and deep appreciation to Mark Nelson for his reading of “The Planet Savers” and “A Princess of Mars”. http://librivox.org/the-planet-savers-by-marion-zimmer-bradley/http://librivox.org/a-princess-of-mars-by-edgar-rice-burroughs-2/ We listen to unwind and relax before bed, and usually fall asleep to Mark’s wonderful voice.  We will definitely be adding to our “Mark Nelson Library” as we make it through to the end of these two – it’s slow going when you only get through partial chapters before being lulled to sleep! Most sincerely,Brent and JaneAll of Mark's recordings
