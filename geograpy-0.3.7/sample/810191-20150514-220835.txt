ok, so finally I've been in discussions with reasonable, non-pedantic, wikipedia admin. we -- like everybody -- are free to make links, but there are some specific guidelines about what's a good link, and what isn't, that we should be careful with. lest we trigger the spam radar. details to follow. 

so let's give wikipedia a little rest for now. and remember that we just had a fight with one of hundreds admins, and he is not wikipedia as a whole.
