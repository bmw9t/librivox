Mike, I noticed that you have been recording here about a year-- I had not heard you till now because I mostly listen to solo projects.    I will definitely be looking for your solo's in future-- what a great voice! Gold stars for expression, reading speed, willingness to tackle foreign language, and the voice quality-- clear enough for listening while driving, and soothing enough for bedtime stories.     ~S~
