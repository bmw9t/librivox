Mike,

Thank you!  

I've downloaded the file and am listening now.  10 minutes in, and it sounds perfect.  A very understanding delivery, helpful to the listener.  Your efforts have paid off!

In terms of recording and editing, I find two things helpful (when I can do them):-
-- Noticing mistakes as I read.  
-- Repeating the phrase or sentence straight away, and matching the tones etc. as well as possible.

When I can do those things, editing is a doddle and largely undetectable.

With such a long piece, though, what I find difficult is recognising when my voice or delivery deteriorates.  Knowing when to stop, in other words.

Anmyway, no pearls of wisdom there.

Now 20 minutes in, and still perfect! 

David
