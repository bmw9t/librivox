Hi Samanem,Thanks for the reply. I have studied the guide quite thoroughly and have been experimenting with mics and the audacity software. Am planning to do and upload the test today. I wish I could afford (or rather justify the expense of) a condenser mic, but I'll do the best I can with my sennheiser headset.Just one question: do you recommend recording on audacity directly in mono - or in stereo and then drop it to mono when it exports to Mp3. Does it make any difference??("Soon" - meant I'll post again soon   )Real name is Tim - but I like "journeyman" because it sums up the precariousness (??!) of my professional life.Thanks again for the post
