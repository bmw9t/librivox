then when your file is complete go to  http://www.pdfonline.com/ and convert.

PDFOnline will allow you to convert .png files, but I don't think it will allow you to select multiple .pngs and make them one file... so the .doc or .rtf route would be the way to go.

I've dabbled in the PHP -> PDF creation, but not often enough.
