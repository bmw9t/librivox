Autobiography of a seaman (volume II) by  Lord Thomas Cochrane (1775 - 1860).  Quote: This second volume of the biography of Lord Cochrane deals with his fall from grace, imprisonment for debt, loss of honours, and attempts to clear his name. It has had a marked influence on naval fiction, most obviously on some of the novels by Patrick O'Brian.
