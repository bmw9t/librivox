I meant to say the MW is blank until I enter it thru the "BC Admin" button at the bottom of the MW; then the new system comes up; I don't know if this is standard.  I'm going to suppose these "posted" sections will download now.I don't think I was ever able to download from the MW (i.e. it didn't work that way); browser is Internet Explorer (64  bit), running on Windows 7.Have you found the sections that didn't appear in your uploader?
