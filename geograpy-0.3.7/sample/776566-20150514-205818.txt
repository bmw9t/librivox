I didn't know when I opened my big mouth about doing this that LibraryLady was already doing it as a solo project. I've already got my heart set on it, though... I don't suppose it will hurt to have two solos of the same book?

I'm about to edit the first post with all the various information that goes so nicely there, and then I'll see if I can do a chapter.
