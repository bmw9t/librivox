Hi Don,Thank you very much for your kind words and your corrected file. Everything is fine now: section 1 is PL OK!   The 'only' think I can tell from your voice is that you are a very good reader. So don't be 'worried' about your age (actually I think that's it what makes your voice very fascinating (for me)) or that your are new to Librivox (I'm only 25 hours longer than you a registered member but followed the forums almost two years as a passive guest before) or about confusing something, that's no problem at all. You're doing a great job!   I'm too, looking forward to our collaboration and the following recordings.   Greetings Kajo
