I'm about to begin a book by Dhan Gopal Mukerji. It includes some words (below) that I'd like to pronounce without making Indian listeners cringe like I did in my version of Siddhartha. For example, in the UK they say HimaLAYas; in the US it's often HimMALias. Is either the way people in northeastern India pronounce it? I've no idea.Yes, India is a big country and there's a lot of variation. But it would be nice if at least someone would be able to say well for a Brit he did a pretty fair job. Phonetic transliteration would be appreciated but an mp3 of the right way would be great! You could PM me. Many thanks.-- AdrianPlaces and names: Dhan Gopal Mukerji NahraKariSuduKopeeBenaresHimalayas Fayu (a fox)Verbs and nouns:dhat (sit)mali (walk)howdah (a seat)mohula (a type of plant)Ghaut (ritual stairs into the Ganges)ankus (a prod or goad to drive animals)
