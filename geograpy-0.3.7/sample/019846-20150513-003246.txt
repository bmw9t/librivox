Hi, I am Paul. I am a 59 year old retired lecturer. I have a close friend who is blind and began to explore Librivox with him in mind. However, I have always been good at reading and have done recordings for BBC radio in the past so I thought it would be a good idea to volunteer. When I have got to grips with the software I will put my name down for something.
