Thanks for that, I was afraid that the pages were being "generated" by hand rather than automatically, which does make it harder for you guys 

I've not tried the arvhive.org pages, finding stuff there can be a little bit...trying at times, but I'll give it a go if I decide to download project which is particularly populous, thanks for the suggestion!

Hopefully when (or if?) you get to switch over to storing the information for each book in a database, then this will become very easy to implement as you say.  For now, I reckon I can live with the little bit of hardship of selecting links individually 

Thanks!
