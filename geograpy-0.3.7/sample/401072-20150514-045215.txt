Diary of an Old Soul by George MacDonald (December 1824 – September 1905). This project is now complete! All audio files can be found on our catalog page: http://librivox.org/diary-of-an-old-soul-by-george-macdonald/ Quote:George MacDonald, a Scottish pastor, wrote these short poems, one for each day of the year, to help him with the severer misfortune he was experiencing. The poems are filled with Hope and promises of Christ, yet, he also writes about his doubts. These poems are wonderful to listen to for people of any religion. (Summary by Alisson Veldhuis) How to claim a part, and 'how it all works' here To find a section to record, simply look at point 5. below at the sections. All the ones without names beside them are “up for grabs.” Click "Post reply" at the top left of the screen and tell us which section you’d like to read (include the section number from the left-most column in the reader list, please). Read points 6. to 8. below for what to do before, during and after your recording. New to recording? Please read our Newbie Guide to Recording! Is there a deadline? We ask that you submit your recorded sections within 1-2 months of placing your claim (or by the target completion date, whatever is sooner). Please note that to be fair to the readers who have completed their sections in a timely way, if you haven't submitted your recording(s) after two months, your sections will automatically be re-opened for other readers to claim, unless you post in this thread to request an extension. Extensions will be granted at the discretion of the Book Coordinator. If you cannot do your section, for whatever reason, just let me know and it’ll go back to the pool. There’s no shame in this; we’re all volunteers and things happen. The target completion date for this project is August 1, 2011. Where do I find the text?
