Hmm. I can see how this would be fun if everyone involved doesn't see it as a competition.

However, there are always people who will do that, and I think many new readers might not sign up in fear of getting no votes. These things always tend to turn into popularity contests.

I know that I, English being my second language, would be hesitant if I knew I was compared to native speakers.

One thing I love about librivox is the diversity and the acceptance of every dialect, accent and way to read. I'd be afraid that would be compromised.
