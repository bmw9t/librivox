Sam, I'm just checking in very quickly before heading back out (my cat is having an echocardiogram ) but I will give you more Magic Window info later.  An MC has to set those up but then you can edit them once you have the login info.

Esther, thank you very much for proofing!  I'll work on the cataloging later this afternoon!
