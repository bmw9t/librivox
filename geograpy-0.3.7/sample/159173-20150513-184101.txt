May I read the Marquis – A financially ruined aristocrat who has had to sell his noble title. He believes that his honor and protection alone can win Mirandolina’s love, as expressed by his oft-repeated mantra, “I am who I am.” ?I was wondering about the wealthy Count, but financially ruined but honorable is probably a better match.Thanks, Todd
