I put up one of the "Heard any good books lately?" flyers on our "advertising wall" (it's next to our canteen, so gets seen by a lot of people) in my company and also in our online marketplace (in the free section)... I don't think it brought any readers but maybe a listener or 2  and a lot of people now have "heard" of it at least... probably only subconciously but our subconscious is a powerful thing (next step: World Domination )But if someone ends up doing a Librivox ad-thingy... I had some ideas:"Not enough drama in your life? Join Librivox and create your own!""Bored with your life? Try being someone else on Librivox""Have you always wanted to be insert famous character here? Now you can - with Librivox!"
