Section 32 uploaded, The Mask (or Masque) of Anarchy:Text URL: http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/the-mask-of-anarchy/MP3 URL: http://upload.librivox.org/share/uploads/ek/shelleyselectedpoems_32_shelley.mp3Duration:  17:29This is Shelley at his most revolutionary, inspired by the Peterloo Massacre, when cavalry troops attacked unarmed peaceful protesters in Manchester. Shelley was sometimes accused of being an anarchist himself, but this charge was entirely false. He was violently opposed to anarchy, as seen in this poem, but what he calls anarchy here is not lack of rule, but misrule--unfair and oppressive rule. His proposed solution to what he saw as anarchy was the plainest kind of call for passive resistance--or nonviolent protest or civil disobedience--whatever you want to call it. The people were simply to stop serving their cruel masters; they were not to take up arms, but just cease being slaves. When they were attacked, as they would be, they were to silently submit to the violence of their assailants, until eventually the injustice would become so obvious that the oppressors would have to cease and would become abhorred. I don't know to what extent Thoreau was influenced by this poem when he wrote "Civil Disobedience," but I do know that Gandhi was fond of quoting lines from it during his long, and eventually triumphant, struggle for independence in India.Len
