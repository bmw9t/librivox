Quote:Beat you Alex! 

Mine were done by midnight last night, but I didn't need to post them to myself, so didn't mention it here.  So let's call it a draw :)

One more obstacle now prevents us from completing this entirely, and me handing on the torch to Kara -- going through to get the cataloguing data, I now find that for some reason one set of chapters won't play for me.  I don't know at what point they have got corrupted (and I've had a lot of computer trouble recently), but I have asked the person who recorded them (Hugh) whether they he still has a copy.

We're getting there!

I will zip up the whole lot of the ones I have, and Yousendit in one file to Kara.
