Hello all-
 I initially wanted to do an audio podcast of all the short stories of Anton Chekhov in it's original Constance Garnett translation. Then I found Librivox. I haven't done anything as of yet but I do have all the collected works volumes which are verified under Project Gutenberg as public domain. 
 The first volume is here on Librivox but I want to volunteer to do each volume. I realize it's a huge undertaking but Russian literature is a passion of mine. Can I "claim" the remaing volumes and do them all myself? 
 I realize it sounds greedy but I'd like to do more as a personal challenge but also as an interest based adventure of sorts and to look back on it and be proud of my contribution in helping out. Advice?
