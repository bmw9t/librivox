Hello Michele and MaryAnn, I hope you are both doing well. I just re-uploaded Chapters 9 and 10 into the Magic Window as they didn't appear when I checked just now and I assume that they must have been posted after July 11th. Please note, however, Michele that you already proofread these before. I also uploaded Chapter 11 which is new and needs to be proofread. The dB is 89.  I hope I did this properly. If I didn't please let me know, MaryAnn, and I will redo it. I added the 128kb to the filenames. I hope this was correct. Thanks to both of you and have a great day. Best wishes...........Larraine.
