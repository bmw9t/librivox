Interesting text this - is sometimes difficult to follow for a modern day person how Plato actually envisions anatomy & physiology. And his views on evolution were special too. Quoted totally out of context, but it made me stop in my reading as you can imagine :
"Of the men who came into the world, those who were cowards or led unrighteous lives may with reason be supposed to have changed into the nature of women in the second generation."

Section 19:

24:48

Section 20:

18:57

If it is not considered too greedy, I'd like to tackle section 17 and 18 as well.
