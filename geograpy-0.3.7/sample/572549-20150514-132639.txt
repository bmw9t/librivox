Absolutely no reason to bury your head Mark!    I notice that most recordings of the Bible in Librivox are done with Word-Perfect Proof Listening requested.  It only makes sense to want to be as "perfect" as possible when dealing with holy writ.  I'm trying to live up to a Word Perfect recording myself with Leon's WEB OT project (I promise to pick up the pace there, by the way, Leon!).

But I find that for me personally, trying for Word Perfect somehow squelches the Spirit of the text to a certain extent.  For this wonderful translation in particular I really want my reading to be as natural and transparent as possible so that for any listeners the TCNT will be 'living and active and sharper...'  Well, you know the rest.
