Hi all...

I regisitered awhile back after catching the LibriVox article in Reason, and have finally found some time to donate to this remarkable project.

I'm a writer who also does voiceover for computer based training CDs, and the odd voicemail system and corporate video. I've also done volunteer readings over the years at CRIS in both Connecticut and Chicago. (CRIS is a radio information service for the visually impared--I generally read the local paper live, and recorded magazine articles for monthly spots.)

The radio information service here in Florida (my latest home), has a schedule that's not conducive to my work hours, and I believe LibriVox can fill that empty spot in my life.

I'm heading over to the short stories thread now, and I'm very much looking forward to working with you all!

Gracie
