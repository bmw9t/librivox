Brilliant! I was thinking of doing this one next, but wanted to finish The Riddle of the Sands first. This way I'll get the Slocum sooner!  This is a great book.

I'll MC this for you, and will be your dedicated proof-listener, if you like (i.e. listening to files as they come in).

So. You're a sailor? Tell me more.
