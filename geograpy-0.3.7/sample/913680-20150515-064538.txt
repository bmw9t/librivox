I remember visiting a shop in Brighton that was at the bottom of a hill. Whenever there was a thunderstorm the runoff in the public sewer was so great that there was a backflow up the private drain serving the shop, creating a 'Versailles effect' or fountain of shit and contraceptives from their wc pan, more than six feet high.hefyd
