I know some other MCs do ... it's just luck as to whether the problem occurs with such an MC -- AND within a reasonable time.  Mostly the completed files do wait around a month or two on whatever server they've been sent to (I do this, anyway, but I think it's more common than not.)  It's when the problem is reported after that, that it's a real pain.

For reference, I'm pretty mid-scale, MC & BCwise, and I'd have 37 extra CDs around my house currently.  Apart from the cost, it'd take a fair bit of time and I'm already cramped for space.
