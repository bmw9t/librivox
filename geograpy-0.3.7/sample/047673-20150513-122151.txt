Oooh, Romola's on there ... you suggested that eons ago, Stav, and I've read it since and really enjoyed it.  Definitely want to get that in the catalogue some time.  Has the honour of being the only George Eliot I've read (so many books, so little time.)

And two Disraelis ... I'm loving reading his Sybil at the moment, but would help with either of the other two, he's a very good writer.
