Gabrielle - Sure, no problem.  Mike - I just noticed that you haven't submitted a one-minute test.  Did you record this who chapter as a test?  Or just a short piece of it?  We like people to work out their technical specs on a short recording so that they don't spend too much time recording a longer section that ends up not being usable.  If you did record the whole section, no problem.  We can hopefully work through any tech issues, if there are any.
