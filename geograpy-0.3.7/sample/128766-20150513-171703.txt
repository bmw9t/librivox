Thank you Teemu.  I've added you to the MW as the DPL so that you can update the PL status as you complete sections.You'll need to start by logging into the magic window.  Instructions are in the BC/DPL How-to; and this is a more detailed version of the First Login instructions (with pictures!)  Please be sure to read all of the BC/DPL How To document, as that will give you more information on updating the PL status of sections.If you have questions or any trouble getting in the MW with these instructions, please let me know.MaryAnn
