I hate to say it, but this is the last chapter for Narrator of High Acres.  It's been a lot of fun reading the story of Jerry Travis' adventures.  If an editor is needed to move this project along, please let me know!  Until then, have a blessed Christmas & a Happy New Year!https://librivox.org/uploads/maryannspiegel/highacres_narrator_29.mp3
