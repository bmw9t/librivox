And another good story brought to life much better for me by reading aloud.  I love being read to.Couple of things:At .28 and 3:44, would you change "Section 1 and Section 2" to "Part 1 and Part 2", to differentiate it from the Section titles.  I will make this addition to the instructions.17:01 "one" of the herd, should say "none"18:27 "vivid" stampede should say "wild"All specs are good.These will make it PL OK.  And, if you are interested in perfecting your piece even more, there's a POP or CLICK between 13:13 - 13:14, which could be removed while you're at the other fixes.Good job!
