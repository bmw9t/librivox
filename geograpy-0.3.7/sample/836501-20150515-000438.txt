Hi,

I am an ESL teacher and use your site to help my students develop their ability to understand recorded language. We really enjoy listening to the short stories and sometimes follow along with a text....this site is a teacher's dream.

Currently we are working on becoming good readers (enunciating, using inflection etc) and I was wondering if my class could record something for the site. I think it would really motivate them to know that what they read could be heard by people all over the world. My class consists of five 8th grade boys, so I thought perhaps we could do a poem, or if they are feeling really ambitious, a short story. However, before I even suggest this to them I was wondering if you have age restrictions, or discourage young readers because of the immaturity of their voices. Could you let me know if my class could volunteer to be Librivox readers?

Thank you
