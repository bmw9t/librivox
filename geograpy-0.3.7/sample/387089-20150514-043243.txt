Hello again!Here are wordperfect PL notes for Section 01:~00:50 "of all the things that come-to-be" missing (pdf: p.161, line 4)Section 02: PL-OKAnother thing I would like to mention is about the intros. I'm wondering whether it would sound better if the intro included all chapters recorded in each section (that is, if it began "Chapters 1 and 2 of ...",  "Chapters 1 through 5 of ..." for Section 6, etc). Then again, maybe this is your own way of recording, and I'm not yet familiar with it.   I downloaded all sections to compare the intros, and I ended up with one more thing to mention; it's about the reference to the Book #, whereas it's present in all sections of book 2, it's only present in the first of the 5 sections of book 1.Section 01 starts "Chapter 1 of Book 1 of On Generation and Corruption."Section 02 starts "Chapter 3 of On Generation and Corruption [...]"Section 03 starts "Chapter 5 of On Generation and Corruption [...]"Section 04 starts "Chapter 7 of On Generation and Corruption [...]"Section 05 starts "Chapter 9 of On Generation and Corruption [...]"Section 06 starts "Chapter 1 of Book 2 of On Generation and Corruption [...]"Section 07 starts "Chapter 6 of Book 2 of On Generation and Corruption [...]"Section 08 starts "Chapter 10 of Book 2 of On Generation and Corruption [...]"That's it for now, I hope I am not too tiresome with details!I'll work with Sections 3 and 4 next ====Back with PL notes for Section 3:~21:29 "those who generate the 'elements'" missing (pdf: p.190, line 4)Section 4: PL notes pm-ed====Section 5:~8:15 "The behaviour of these metals" I heard materials (pdf: p.209, line 3)Section 6: PL-OK====Section 7: PL-OKSection 8: PL-OK
