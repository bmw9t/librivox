...and jump in!  I'm a brand new reader and have just signed up.  I did a bit of experimentation over the weekend to see if a could do this and I think my biggest problem was using the mic built in to my computer.  I'm going to pick up a better mic after work today and give this a proper try.  I just downloaded 'Out Around Rigel' by Robert H. Wilson (because it was at the top of the list   ) and we'll see how this goes.
