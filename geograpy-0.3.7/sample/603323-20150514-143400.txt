Quote:I noticed that both 11 and 12 were only just under one hour long. Is that because you believed that one hour is the limit? If so, you should know that the limit is whatever will fit onto a CD, so is usually taken to be about 70 minutes. I hope that doesn't make you squeal with frustration  

Well, it's more that I think they're getting quite long for single sections!  But anyway, they were only around 60 minutes when I had finished recording them. They were a minute or two over that but I cut them down slightly.
