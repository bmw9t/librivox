Human Toll by  Barbara Baynton (1857 - 1929). This project is now complete! All audio files can be found on our catalog page: https://librivox.org/human-toll-by-barbara-baynton/Quote: Ursula (Ursie) Ewart, orphaned as a young child, is sent away from her home in the Australian bush. While Ursie was previously doted on by station hands, Boshy, Nungi,and Queeby, at her new home, in a nearby country town, she is barely tolerated. Her only confidante is Andrew (Andree), an older child in the same household. In Human Toll, Barbara Baynton builds on her observations in Bush Studies to provide further insight into women's experience of Australian bush life and culture at the turn of the 20th century.

If we don't hear from you for three months, your project may be opened up to a group project if a Book Coordinator is found. Files you have completed will be used in this project. If you haven't recorded anything yet, your project will be removed from the forum (contact any admin to see if it can be re-instated).Please don't download or listen to files belonging to projects in process (unless you are the BC or PL). Our servers are not set up to handle the greater volume of traffic. Please wait until the project has been completed. Thanks!Magic Window:
