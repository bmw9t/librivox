THANK YOU SAM! I can't be excited enough! This book has really been fun and boy you've helped speed up the processed a LOT.    THANK YOU fiddlesticks for such prompt PLing.    I can't believe how, I'm barely done updating the MW, and you've already PLed something. Whoa..  .they SHOULD give an award out for the best DPLers ever!  THANKS
