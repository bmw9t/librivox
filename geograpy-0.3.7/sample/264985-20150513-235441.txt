great start, deanna! you can of course have a file name like rebelrose_1_01_mccarthy to reflect both the volume and the chapter number. this is up to you, but the section numbers 01-39 might make it simpler. as i said, this is up to you. if you want, i can change the file name of the first section for you if you decide to take the extra 1 into the file name
