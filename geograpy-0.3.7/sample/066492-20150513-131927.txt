Just some ideas about casting Aimee, since you seem to be struggling with that--feel free to dismiss my ideas if you'd like.  After all, I'm not volunteering myself to read anything in this book cause all my accents suck, so it's better for everyone if I stick to editing.  But I listened to Elizabeth's (Gloriana's) solo of this book some time ago, and she seemed to me to do an excellent job with the French accent (as she did with everything else, for that matter). You might also try asking some of the readers involved in the Villette DR, which involves a lot of French.
