It might be distorted. . . I did not start listening to my efforts before I started doing Treasure Island. I have done all of Wind in the Willows, but it is not proofread. Would you like me to upload it  anyway? i was trying to make my audio books as perfect as possible. I have listened to many audio books that lacked passion, and that is the one thing I could accept in a audio book, but never like. I really like Graphic Audio, and have tried to make my latter audio books with sound effects. and things like that. I find that Garage Band works VERY well for me, but I have not figured out Audacity.
