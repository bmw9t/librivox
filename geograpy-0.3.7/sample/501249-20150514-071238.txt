Hi all,

apologies. Been absent without leave for some time now. I've been a bit pre-occupied with getting my business moving forward. I'm hoping to get some recording done in the next week or so and will try to give this priority over everything else (even stuff I'm getting paid for!).

Asy - hope you're feeling a bit better now!

Simon
