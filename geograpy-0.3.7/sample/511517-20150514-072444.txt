Good job, Tim! Now that you've gotten a couple of sections ready for proofing, you might want to wander on over to the "Listeners & Editors wanted" forum and post and advertisement asking for proof-listeners. Use a subject line something like "[IP] PL Wanted: Luther's Commentary on Galatians", and include a link back to this thread in the body of the post. You could also copy and past the summary into it as well, to give prospective PL'ers an idea of what the project is about. I usually ask listeners to claim and post findings in the book thread, rather than in the thread in teh "Wanted" forum, as those threads are (fairly) regularly deleted when the project is over with, and the posts that are there are lost. Posts here will be effectively archived, as this thread will get moved over into "Completed Works" once it's in the catalog.

Once you have a DPL, the subject line on the "Wanted" post can be changed to "PL Found", and that will indicate to listeners that the project has a dedicated proof listener.
