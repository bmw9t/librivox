Thanks tiberius, I'll sign you up for that one 

Just a quick suggestion. If you put important information in the title of a post, no one will see it unless they know to look for it. It's in such a small text, and in such an out of the way place, that no one really looks at it. At first I was confused because all I saw of your post was this...

"hello I'd like to volunteer for this chapter"

By the way, welcome to LibriVox!
