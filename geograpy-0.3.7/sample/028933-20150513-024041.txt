Hi Nivedita, and welcome! You have a lovely voice, and have all the technical settings right for what LibriVox requires, so that's fantastic. I would make two suggestions:

1 - raise your mic input volume if you can (on Audacity or whatever recording programme you're using, and/or through your computer's control panel settings) as it could do with being a bit louder (this is better than amplifying the finished recording because that can bring up the background hiss too much).

2 - experiment with positioning the mic in different places to try to reduce the slight popping on 'p's that's coming through - it's when a puff of air hits the mic so usually shifting it more to the side of or above your mouth where it's out of the line of fire helps. It's not massively problematic as it is by any means, but it can probably be improved.

Hope you find lots of projects to inspire you to record! And just ask if you need any help. Hope to hear more of you soon
