Part 10 is ready for review. Argonauts 5: "...Unknown Sea" comes in at 54:19 and 50.9 MB.

I've done some processing on the voice of the magic bough (track doubling) and the voice of the brass giant (track doubling with pitch lowering). Since these are secondary tracks, I haven't actually done anything to the original, so it's all undoable if you think it's hard to understand.

Greek myths rock. Check out Medeia, Jason's evil genius witch girlfriend.
