Is there a way to hear yourself in a headset while you are recording?

Audacity has a feature it calls "Software playthrough" (see Edit > Preferences > Recording).

However, the audio in the headphones has a latency of about 1/2 second, even if the Latency settings are changed to zero.

Does anyone know how to configure Audacity to get this effect? I am using a USB microphone, if that matters. 

I'd really like to hear the audio as I am recording it.

Thanks.
