Designcrit -- I am completely blown away. It's gorgeous, elegant, perfect.  I have not printed it, only looked at it on my screen.

If there are no objections, we could link to your PFD pack on the catalog page for The Waste Land.  If you don't want to host the files yourself (or want us to  host them in addition) I think we could easily keep them on archive or ibiblio.

My word.  Please create more!  Sure, you could create a new thread and post all your designs there, or post in each book's COMPLETED thread.
