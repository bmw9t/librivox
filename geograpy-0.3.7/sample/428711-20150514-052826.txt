The Bruised Reed by Richard Sibbes (1577â€“1635). This project is now complete! All audio files can be found on our catalog page: http://librivox.org/the-bruised-reed-by-richard-sibbes/ Quote:Richard Sibbes was a Puritan pastor and theologian in the 17th century. His best known work, The Bruised Reed, is based on a Scripture verse from Matt. 12:20: "A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory." Sibbes uses this text to respond to the despondent thoughts and fears that many Christians have. He draws a picture of Christ's gentleness and mercy for the Christians who feel themselves small and weak. The Bruised Reed is full of an amazing amount of soul-comfort. I cannot recommend it highly enough, especially to Christians struggling with depression, regret, or fear.The publishers' foreword quotes Dr. Martyn Lloyd Jones, who said: "I shall never cease to be grateful to . . . Richard Sibbes who was balm to my soul at a period in my life when I was overworked and badly overtired, and therefore subject in an unusual manner to the onslaughts of the devil. In that state and condition . . . what you need is some gentle, tender treatment for your soul. I found at that time that Richard Sibbes, who was known in London in the early seventeenth century as 'the heavenly Doctor Sibbes', was an unfailing remedy. His books The Bruised Reed and The Soul's Conflict quietened, soothed, comforted, encouraged and healed me."(Introduction by rosea) Target completion date: October 2011Text source (only read from this text!): I will use the physical copy I have of the book (it's in the public domain), but an online source of the same text can be found at http://www.monergism.com/bruisedreed.htmlType of proof-listening required (Note: please read the PL FAQ): StandardIMPORTANT - soloist, please note: in order to limit the amount of languishing projects (and hence the amount of files on our hard-pressed server), we ask that you post an update at least once a month in your project thread, even if you haven't managed to record anything. If we don't hear from you for three months, your project may be opened up to a group project if a Book Coordinator is found. Files you have completed will be used in this project. If you haven't recorded anything yet, your project will be removed from the forum (contact any admin to see if it can be re-instated). =========================================== Magic Window:
