Thanks.  Here's my test recording.

If it doesn't sound good, I'll switch to my USB mic at home.  (Doing this from my office at the moment.)

Oops...just realized I should have posted this in the Listeners and Editors wanted forum.  I'll wait to do that until after I've re-recorded it with my USB mic.
