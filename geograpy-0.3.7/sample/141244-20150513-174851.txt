Hi Laurie Anne,I have amplified to -3.8 and this seems to have resolved the sited issues on both submissions. I have updated the MW accordingly.  If I've gone to far with the amp., let me know and I'll tweak it again.  By what method do you determine the percentage levels and how may I employ it to our mutual benefit?  Thanks for your kind comments regarding the presentation.  Only problem is it takes me a little while to stop talking like that around the house.BTW:  Are you Silmarillion qualified?  If so, are you familiar with "The Tolkein Professor" podcast?  Cheers for now,-Scott
