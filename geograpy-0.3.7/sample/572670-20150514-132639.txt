Hi,

My PL notes for Section 33 were done, but I simply forgot where they were!!!        My most humble apologies, sir!

Sections 6, 8, 9, and 11 were good.  

Section 7---at 5:13 (verse 8), you read, "for where there is no consciousness of SIN, sin shows no sign of life"; should read, "for where there is no consciousness of LAW..."

Section 10---at 19:34 (verse 19), you read, "Against an undiscerning nation WHICH will arouse your anger"; should read, "I will arouse your anger".

Also, cut the end silence by 5 seconds.

Again, very sorry for this!
