Also, there is no accompaniment in this book, so we can't use an accompaniment, can we? Not without a load of hassel for the Mc making sure it is PD (even if we play it ourselves, the accompaniment music we play from must be checked to make sure it isn't from somewhere that changed the duration of one note and slapped a copyright onto it!) Other than that, can I reserve 95- Guilde me, o Thou Great Jehovah? #95 is thine.
