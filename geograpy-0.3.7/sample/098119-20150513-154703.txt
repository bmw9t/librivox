Section 24, Protection For American Actors, is compiled and uploaded.https://librivox.org/uploads/rapunzelina/ingersollinterviewsvol2_24_128kb.mp3  19:01  Your turn, Mr. Brown.I actually found 2 errors but was able to correct them myself by copying and pasting, as follows:1:52 old county, I believe this is a typo, should read "old country" as it refers to bringing companies of actors over to America from Europe.  As it happened, I found another instance where you used the word "country" and pasted it in over "county".  You can't even tell.8:26 services of any kind the U.S., obviously the word 'in' is missing, should read "in the U.S.".  I found another 'in the' and pasted that in, too.I mention these to make sure you know you are allowed to make changes to the printed text if you are reasonably certain it is a typo or omission.  Ack! Ack! Ack!  Typesetters make lots of mistakes.  Every letter set is another chance to screw up!  It actually amazes me that they get so much right.   In addition,  your background noise was quite high.  I did some noise removal and got yours about matching mine, and lowered your amplification of 91.8 down by -2.5 to 89.3, again to match mine.Nice reading!
