Since we're using the direct Archive.org scan, this isn't something that can be put down to OCR error, as it often can with Gutenberg, unless you're reading from the OCRed version rather than the scan (a bad idea with Archive.org, incidentally), in which case, go ahead and check the PDF to see what it says. However, if you can find another scan of a different edition (also PD of course!) which reads "characteristics," then we can put it down to a printer's error. Lacking that information, however, we will have to assume that the word was the author's intent.Arielle,Yeah. I checked the PDF already. There were a bunch of wild OCR errors in the other text versions.It says characters, characters it is:)brendan
