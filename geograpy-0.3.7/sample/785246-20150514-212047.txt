Treesh, I don't envy you your task.
How on earth are you going to keep a straight face while reading Chapter 9: "The Use of Sewing Cards"

"People get to very queer places on that [magic] carpet.
I have been for several excursions on it so I know.
One of the places it can take you is a town where all the front doors open to a street very like Regent Street; with the most gorgeous millinery, jewellery, and fruits in shop windows; and all the back doors open to wild country where blue roses, black tulips, and the fattest double carnations of all colours (including green ones) grow wild in the hedges and fields; and where all the pigs have wings.
Another place it can take you is one where pigs can wallow in all the filth they like without soiling their wings; and moths flew into candles without singeing theirs.
The carpet will take you to whatever place you wish to go to. It is by no means warranted to take you safely back.
The advantage of the Boole method is that it is warranted to bring you safe down somewhere on solid earth, - not always the exact place you started from, but in a safe and clean place of some kind- and to deposit you steady on your feet, with a compass in your pocket which will show you a straight way home."

My first impressions:
1. I took many courses in algebra (including Boolean Algebra) and I never heard of any of this, imagine living in ignorance for all these years.
2. I didn't know they had LSD back in 1909.
3. I still don't know what sewing cards are and how they relate to algebra or pigs.
