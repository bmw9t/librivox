I don't know. I had a bad experience with a Hong Kong seller who sent me a faulty product and then didn't give me my money back even after I sent it back and he said he would give me a full refund   . When I tried to contact him he wouldn't return my emails. I might just buy one from amazon, I know it is more expensive, but I will be sure of what I get.
