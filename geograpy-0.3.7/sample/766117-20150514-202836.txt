Looking for a P/L'er? I'll be happy to assist, since Phantom of the Opera isn't quite finished being recorded yet, and this one's done.

Can't promise to finish P/L'ing it in one day though...maybe two or three, but should be done before the end of the week (unless someone else is eagerly awaiting the chance to listen).
