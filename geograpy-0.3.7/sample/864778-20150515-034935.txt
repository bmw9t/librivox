Well, let us look ahead, gaiffelet. 

What is it that you'd like to do?  I assume you're into recording. :o)

You'll find infos on the way LV works in the links from the Homepage (the French translation of it still needs updating but nothing has changed in the fundamentals).


Cheers,

PS: Things you may like to know : for LibriVox, we need the books we read to be in the public domain (in the USA, first published before 1923, as our files are hosted there. And in the country one records from so that it's legal there too) and we release our audiofiles (mp3, 128kbps, 44.1kHZ) into the public domain, which means there is no copyright of any kind and anyone can do anything they like with them (sell them, make songs out of them, remix them, use bits of them for sound effects,...). 
Each recording has to have the LV disclaimer (intro and outro. Those are detailed, with other infos, in the very first post of each project's thread). 
We are to read the text as it is, no editing of the text (no leaving out a part of a novel we don't like, for instance).  

See you around!
