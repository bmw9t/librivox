Hi Anna,It is indeed -- thanks for asking! I'm aware that this is getting embarrassing  The cunning plan at the moment is to do a block of editing after over the holiday, with the able assistance of my new flatmate (who plays space cadet Roger in the recordings!). I'll post an update then -- I may ask for volunteers for particular specific tasks, to power through this asap. Watch this space!Stuart.
