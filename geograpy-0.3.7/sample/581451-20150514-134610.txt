I mean, if there aren't likely to be any PLs who could understand Russian - would you give this story a go? Nevertheless, I start recording it.P.S. http://az.lib.ru/a/andreew_l_n/text_0040.shtml - there's the text

Oh, we will find someone who can PL.  I should be delighted to include a Russian contribution. It was published in 1899?
