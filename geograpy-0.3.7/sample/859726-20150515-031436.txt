Praise for gypsygirl (Karen Savage) via the 'Thank a reader' feature:
Quote:I want to comment on a reader, Karen Savage, who has read things in Spanish. She is a great reader! I'll look for more of her work on Librivox.Sincerely,MK.-P.Karen's LibriVox recordings are here.More praise:Quote:Dear Karen,I'm writing to thank you for your wonderful readings for Librivox.  Several long car journeys with our two children (Bridget, 6, and Tom, 4) have been made not just bearable but positively delightful by your readings of The Railway Children and Anne of Green Gables.  Of course, you did make the driver cry (especially at the end of the Railway Children - you capture Bobby's greeting to her father on the platform so well!), but we won't hold that against you!  Thank you for such expressive, enjoyable, and versatile performances.  If you ever felt like doing more solo readings of other E. Nesbit works, you would find a family of eager listeners here.All best wishes,Mike, Hester, Bridget and Tom.And yet more praise!Quote:Just to thank Karen Savage for her Librivox recordings â€“ so brilliantly done with the right mix of clarity and interpretation. They shine out.Julie F.
