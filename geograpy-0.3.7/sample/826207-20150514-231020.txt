It's only obvious when you know how!  I had a very similar experience, also while recording with a big beautiful Yeti, though mine has its own mic stand.  I use a laptop on a wooden shelf to record to and read from ... and yes, that was vibrating away for some time too, just a quiet hum, but against the wooden shelf, it was amplified rather unfortunately. A few layers of non-slip matting (because that's what I happened to have lying around) has fixed it all up a treat - and also, because it's just at either side of the laptop, allows for more air flow underneath which is healthier on the fan, too.
