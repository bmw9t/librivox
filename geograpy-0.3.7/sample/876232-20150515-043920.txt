This seems kind of funny...but..it may be a good idea. Perhaps if you do post to slashdot, make an announcement to the community so we can avoid Librivox for a day. Perhaps a day break from the forum/site wouldn't be such a bad thing? People could download the audio books they want for the next day beforehand. I know this would only help out for one day. It's a crazy idea I know..
