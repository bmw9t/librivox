Chap.5. PL OKChap.6. at 11:28. In phrase, Goethe's lines, I think you want to pronounce Goethe's name Gur-tuh. I know the PL ers are supposed to refrain from comments on pronunciation, but Goethe lovers might croak. My app Dictionary.com says the word when you tap the mic. icon. Others dictionaries do too probably. Chap. 7. PL OKI can't find the post where PL Standard Special was described, I think I read it once. I'd appreciate your repeating it so I don't have to find it on librivox website.
