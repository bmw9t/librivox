Thanks for your input Betty, and thank you Bev!I do indeed have in mind a simple note appended to the summary. We've all read Huck Finn, and Hemingway was still dropping n-bombs twenty years after ol'Sherwood. In the same way it's distasteful to modern ears, I'm sure there are words our writers use today that will disgust future generations. I do believe that it's the spirit in which such language is employed that makes all the difference. Bev, I placed the Wikipedia paragraph in there as a placeholder while we sorted that question. I will write a summary of my own and add a note regarding the, shall we say, period language.I did edit the post in order to change the sample file name, but only because it decided to put the full post-colon subtitle in there! It was crazy long. I hope I didn't mess you up.There will need to be some additional sections added. One story is subdivided and runs much longer than the others. I was operating on the initial assumption that it would be two sections, but I'll sort it out when I do the word counts.Best,Ben
