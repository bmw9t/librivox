Looks good.  I have locked it and made it sticky.  The only thing I changed was the [MW]xxxx[/MW] code.  You used the new template code - but actually, if you hover your mouse over the BC/Admin link for the MW, you will see the link for that page - there's 4 numbers at the end . . . this is the magic window code.  You can also see those 4 numbers in the URL when you are in the MW.Someone will come along, quite a few people cruise through there periodically looking for projects and it just takes the right person to pass through with an interest in this sort of thing.
