Not to my knowledge, Evan.  If you find one, be sure to let us know. In case anyone else wonders, MacMP3Gain does not display the volume at all, so it is of no use for our purposes. I wonder if anyone has ever approached the author of this software to ask if this facility could be added.EDIT: Of course, one can use the LibriVox checker program, in which the volume is shown on the Information tab as RMS Amplitude. (The warnings on the Validation tab are not precise enough for this purpose, especially as it does not warn against too high a volume.) This program measures volume in a slightly different way. I am just doing a little comparison exercise. Will report back.EDIT AGAIN: As far as I can see with a quick look, an RMS Amplitude of -22 to -23 seems to be roughly equivalent to 89-90 dB. I should be interested to hear other people's views on this, as for that exercise I only used my own (compressed) files.Ruth
