At the most, I'd suggest a special PL with notation of changes that affect the meaning rather than word perfect.I offered to BC this project for WilliamPeck, and to DPL if he chose Word Perfect.  He responded that he would very much appreciate the stricter standards closer to the level of his professional audio work.  Let me state, I don't take Word Perfect to mean notating every single deviation from the text, only those that change the meaning, tempo or cadence. I ignore most word inversions, for example, "he went slowly up the hill" vs "he slowly went up the hill".  The main difference I see between Word Perfect and Standard is the requirement that the DPL read along with the text, i.e., giving the reader his full attention for the duration of the task.  Only then can they really notice omissions, wrong words, etc. The admins don't seem to understand this, but some of us want that level of support for our recordings, and feel very lucky to get it.  In hindsight, "Word Perfect" was probably not the best choice of words to describe the "read along" standard, but I didn't pick it.  While it seems to connote extreme strictness, to me it really means pretty much what you suggested.
