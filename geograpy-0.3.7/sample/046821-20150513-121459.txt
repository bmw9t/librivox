Today, reading an obituary for Benoît Mandelbrot, inventor of the “fractal,” I was prompted to finally post a suggestion for Robert Hooke’s seminal book on microscopy, MICROGRAPHIA.  

 A quote from Mandelbrot’s NYTimes obituary (10/17/2010), “Applied mathematics had been concentrating for a century on phenomena which were smooth, but many things were not like that: the more you blew them up with a microscope the more complexity you found . . .”  And from Robert Hooke (1665) on looking at the tip of a needle for the first time under a microscope:  “the top of a small and very sharp Needle . . . appear'd through the Microscope above a quarter of an inch broad, not round nor flat, but irregular and uneven; so that it seem'd to have been big enough to have afforded a hundred armed Mites room enough to be rang'd by each other without endangering the breaking one anothers necks, by being thrust off on either side. “ 

Gutenberg has Micrographia translated into “modern” English.. http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15491/15491-h/15491-h.htm.  It would still take somebody with a scientific bent to read his introduction explaining the microscope he built and used, but the rest of his work, consisting of essays on the many varied subjects Hooke studied  (made-made fabrics, leaves, molds, insects, seaweed, even the “gravel in urine,”) would , I think, make an interesting and doable group project.
