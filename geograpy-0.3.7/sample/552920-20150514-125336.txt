You got it, Sandra!  I've freed up the unread claims -- all except for your claim of s11 ... if you want to give that back too, just let me know (I hope not!)

There are several chapters needing proof-listening (that is, someone to listen all the way through and let us know if there are any repeated sections, over-loud noises, or other major problems affecting listenability.)  Anyone can proof-listen!  If anyone is lurking in this thread quietly, and hasn't wanted to take on a full chapter to record -- this is a really important way to help out too!  Just post and say which section you'd like to check.
