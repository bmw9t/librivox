Holly,

Narration is great, but so is dialogue.  I don't care which you do.  Just pick whatever part you think you would most want to do.  I'm marking you down for the dialogue unless you tell me otherwise.

When we get to a point that there is only one part left in a section I might make a request for someone to read that part.  I would have to also have the time to edit it right away before I would make such a request and I have no time to edit.
