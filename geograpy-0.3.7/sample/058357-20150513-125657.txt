Thanks for making the corrections Katie, the file is PL OK now!   I think you did a great job inserting those two pieces, it's not jarring at all.   Such corrections will always be audible, unfortunately, especially if it's longer replacements. You can try to listen to your old recording first, speaking along with it once or twice before recording the replacement, to get a feel of how you were speaking before. In such a case it's better to replace a distince phrase, starting from a comma or end/beginning of a sentence instead of replacing just a word or two. The other way to go is to replace as little as possible, a single sound or consonant. The less you have to redo, the more smooth an edit is possible, but it takes a while to learn how to replace only a single letter. In our case, you'd have to go for the first type of correction, and as I said, you did an admirable job! Let me know if you'd want to read any more sections, okay?
