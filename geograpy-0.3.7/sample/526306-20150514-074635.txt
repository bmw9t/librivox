Hi, Laura & Lucy!  Thanks for your posts of encouragement!  I'm having fun with it, and my husband is so sweet to do the editing and uploading for me!  That means I get to do all of the fun stuff (ie sweating in the closet doing the recording - LOL), while he does the stuff requiring more patience.  (I guess I use up all of my patience during the day with the children.  LOL)  

Thanks for listening, musicmaiden!

Blessings!
