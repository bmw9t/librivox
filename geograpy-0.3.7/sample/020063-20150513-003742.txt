Hi

There are many projects after readers - just look in Readers wanted and find something that you like - my advice is go short at first  
We do like people to do a small test - so we can check all the technical requirements are met in something that is quick to do , upload and download

In the Wiki - linked at top of the page , you will find the newbie guide to recording which includes the 1 minute test instructions - everything you want should be there - but if you have any questions just ask.

Welcome to Librivox, hope you enjoy it round here  

Anne
