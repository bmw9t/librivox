Do you see Surround Mixer in Creative Media Source? With REC and a + in red at the right hand side of the various slider controls? (Not sure which version you have)Oh, and re the disappearing posts - silly question, but I did it myself yesterday, and I am not REALLY stupid...  - are you sure you are clicking submit, and not save?Ruth
