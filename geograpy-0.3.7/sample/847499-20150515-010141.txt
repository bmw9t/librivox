Praise for Kaffen (Mark F. Smith) and chocoholic (Laurie Anne Walden) via the 'Thank a reader' feature:Quote:I am a 51 year old IT Contractor and I have really enjoyed listening to your reading of Sherlock Holmes. I enjoy you reading to me each night as I am getting ready for bed and falling asleep in my 10' x 10' room in Southern and Eastern Afghanistan. I have gone through all of the Sherlock Holmes in the Librivox Library at least twice and I am on the third 'reading' of Hound of the Baskervilles at the moment. Thank you for helping me combat the solitude of the Big Sandbox.Thank you again and have a wonderful Christmas,Paul All of Laurie Ann's recordingsAll of Mark's recordings
