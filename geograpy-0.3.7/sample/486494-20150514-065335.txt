I just saw that you are a new reader, so i need to know under which name or pseudonym you would like to be credited in the catalogue as well as your website, if you have one and if you would like us to link to it.

besides: welcome to LV!  

you can find all you need to know about the test in the Newbie Guide to Recording. The test recording is needed to make sure your technical settings are in order and to walk you through noise cleaning and such things, if it needs to be done. it is usually not a very difficult process and can save you lots of time and stress with your "real" recordings. 

have fun with it, we are waiting to hear from you.
