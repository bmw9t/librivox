I've listen to November, the chapter is ok, there are only few mistakes:

5.52 you said "attaccatricce" instead of attaccaticce
6.56 stumble on "oscuri"
7.40  stumble on "due" and repetition of the whole sentence(7.47)
9.39 you said cima instead of cinghia
10.12 stumble on "martello"
11.05-11.08 stumble and repetition "sono contento....."
14.01 rep "Il carbonaio...
17.17 stumble on "turaccioli"
18.12 stumble on "impara"
19.29 you said "con" but it doesn't make sense in the sentence
24.00 Stumble on "carico"
33.02 you said "baffetti tondi" instead of baffetti biondi
34.39 stumble on "stormi"
35.26 stumble on "lasciare"
4.41 you said "popolo" instead of piccolo in " chi rispetta la bandiera da piccolo...."
57.05 stumble on "cavalleria"
1.01.43 you said "per aver da mangiare" but is "NON aver da mangiare"
add more second of silence at the end because is a long reading.

I neglected all the little variation from the text; I took notice of those that affect the comprehension or the real sense of the text.

I will try to listen to Dicembre and Gennaio but it will take a little long 'cause I'm busy with my work at the moment....so if someone manages to PL them before, it won't be  problem....
