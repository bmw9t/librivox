WOOT! That is really exciting. Now I'll have enough juice from the excitement of publishing solo #2 that I can sink my teeth into Roughing It, which is really kicking my butt with its complicated accents and long poems.

Question: how can I tell if people like my recording? is there like a comments or ratings section somewhere where people can give less technical, more qualitative "loved it/hated it" feedback? has librivox looked into tagging and grading social software like Digg or anything like that? Just curious. I've been in the academic system too long and I crave external validation.
