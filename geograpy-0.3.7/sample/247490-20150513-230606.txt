They're a bit too numerous to list here, but the first two lines of 5.1 are present, while the other seven are not. Please note that the last line of these seven is just assigned to "Noble" rather than "First Noble."How very curious.  As is my usual practice, I recorded all of my parts in the the play into one Audacity file (I record away from my computer) and used the "Export Multiple" to spit out the individual files.  As you note, the Act 5 mp3 seems to be missing much stuff which I know I both recorded and proofed.  But Audacity will not open my entire file anymore - blocks missing throughout! - so somehow something has got dreadfully wrong with the bits and bytes!!  So I'll have to re-record Act 5.  Drat.EDIT:  fixed and uploaded Act 5 of First Noble.  (I cut the new parts into the Act 5 mp3 I had so what you heard before is supposedly unchanged.)Thanks, Todd
