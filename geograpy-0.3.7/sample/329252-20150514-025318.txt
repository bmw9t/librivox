Here is my take on this ages-old feminine complaint:http://upload.librivox.org/share/uploads/dl/chorusofwomen_aristophanes_llw.mp3Duration:  1:17I had a vague suspicion that Aristophanes himself (as up-to-date as he sometimes seems) did not write his poem in colloquial modern English. And since such a translation is often about as much created by the translator as by the original author, I decided to try to track down the translator. After much effort, I discovered that it was done by the Rev. William Lucas Collins (1815-1887), a noted clergyman, a prolific author and translator of classical works. The song is found in the play Thesmophoriazusae, or The Festival of Women. Wow! What a literary coincidence! In Pride and Prejudice, the Bennets' cousin (and Elizabeth's unsuccessful suitor), the Rev. William Collins, marries the daughter of Sir William Lucas.Len
