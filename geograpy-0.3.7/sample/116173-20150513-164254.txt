Sabina PL:1.1 - PL OK1.4 - PL OK (there is a repeat @ 02:21, but it won't affect when the piecing together is done)1.5 - PL OK2.1 - PL OK2.2 - PL OK2.4 - PL OK2.5 - PL OK (there's a repeat @ :018 which can be edited around easily)2.3 - At :044 the text says "You a tyrant!" but was read as "You tyrant!" It comes across to me as a different meaning (calling him a tyrant instead of questioning his belief that she must think him a tyrant), but I suppose it's open to interpretation.  I'm willing to call it PL OK if no one else sees it that way.
