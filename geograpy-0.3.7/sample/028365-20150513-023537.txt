Hi, I'm a student teacher (High School Spanish 3 & 4) and I need to do 8 hours of community service in order to get my certification. (University of Houston requirement).  I would love to record 8 hours of audio.  How long does it take before my recording(s) are available online?  My university supervisor will need to verify the 8 hours of recording before December 5th.  I think I should choose short stories (?) to make it go faster.  What do you suggest?  If I can't prove the 8 hours before Dec. 5 I won't get my certification (yikes!!) Thanks for your time, BDuhart
