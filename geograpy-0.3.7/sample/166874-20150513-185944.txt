Hi Kit! Welcome here!   Congratulations on your first Librivox recording    It is very nicely read. It just needs some adjustment in volume and bg noise. Let's try it. Let's use the Amplify effect (from Effect menu) and amplify by 6dB (this recording measures at 83dB, desired volume range is 87-91, with 89 being ideal). Then let's apply the Noise Removal effect, for the amplified noise, too. And when you're satisfied with the result, export to mp3 again and reupload your updated file  I've added you in the Reader Database! Here's your Reader Page: https://librivox.org/reader/9406You can also access it by opening your name-link in any Magic Window. It shows all projects you've been involved in, so it may look a bit empty now, but it will soon fill up  You can also keep track of your pending sections in the "Reader section details" link below your name there (sections assinged, ready for PL, PL OK etc, according to what's in the Magic Window).
