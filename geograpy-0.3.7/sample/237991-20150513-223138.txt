Caprisha, chapter 1 was wonderful!  You have a beautiful reading style and your enunciation and pacing were both right on the spot for me.   My left foot did get very hot during one part, but did not burst into flame I'm happy to say.   Really, I hope you do LOTS of things here.  Concerning the editing, you obviously know Audacity and do it well.  My first thought on opening the file was that the volume was excellent, but (as J-N pointed out) a bit high.  I would have run a mild compression on it myself, but then I run compression on every file I ever do so that means nothing, eh?
