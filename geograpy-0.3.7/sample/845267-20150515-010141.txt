Thank you for your kind words Kalvin. I'm afraid it wasn't me that recorded Pilgrim's Progress. I've read the book but I'd be very daunted by the task of making an audio version of it.Which of my LibriVox recordings was it that you listened to? It'd be nice to know so that I can see what it was that so impressed you then and try to duplicate it in future.For the LibriVox recordings I've done in the past I had a very complicated set up, with a professional mic and huge mixer and compressor, but the man they belonged to has left the country. I recently purchased a H2 to use instead but I have not had a chance to test it yet.Thanks again,Lucy(I have e-mailed this to Kalvin)
