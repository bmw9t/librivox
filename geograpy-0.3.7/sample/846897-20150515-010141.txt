Praise for sjmarky (Mark Nelson) via the 'Thank a reader' feature:Quote:Hi, I just wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed your reading of Wodehouse’s “Love Among The Chickens”. Your delivery was delightful, with the kind of understated humor that works best with Wodehouse’s works. I’m looking forward to listening to more of your recordings (actually, I’m downloading “My Man Jeeves” at this moment!)Thanks again for a great recording.Yours truly,ChanaLove among the ChickensAll of Mark's recordings
