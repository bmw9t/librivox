What a veritable minefield – certainly the USA is not unique in having complex copyright laws – the King James Bible of 1611 is still under copyright but not enforced outside Great Britain. France does not include the years of ‘occupation’ within it’s ‘death + 70’. America had its renewals, which resulted in many short stories losing their copyright. Some form of standardization would certainly help my befuddled mind. But having placed some literature in the PD it seems quite wrong to then re-copyright. If such legislation were to go through it would make criminals of many of us – are we to delete downloaded works? Will commercial audio-book publishers have to recall the CD’s they distributed? Some sort of “we’re changing the rules for simplicity and conformity but what is already PD stays PD” would seem to be a sensible way forward perhaps?It’s interesting that this should be happening now in the year of Dickens 200th Anniversary.  He used his first visit to America to deliver speeches calling for an International Copyright! It seems they didn’t go down too well…
