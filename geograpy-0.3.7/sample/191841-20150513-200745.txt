Hi, I have linked directly to the Gutenberg text now. What I have read are two sections that describe the two journeys and a few paragraphs earlier and later in the book that mention John Wilson (they are identifiable by searching for 'Wilson' in the text). They are not whole chapters. In fact, I realise now that I can identify the page numbers from a hard copy and include them in the recording. That wouldn't help much at the moment, but it might when the book eventually gets scanned and put on the web.I think the 'don't change the text as it is written policy' was created for another purpose, but if that's the rule, then I'll take this one down. Reading the 500 odd pages I have left out isn't really an an option in this lifetime   May I change the text?Occasionally people ask if they can change the published text, for instance by omitting or substituting offensive words or ideas.The answer is: No. We present the text as it is written: no additions, omissions, or substitutions. If the text contains a word you just cannot say, consider choosing something else to record. (There is so much available to record! No need to cause yourself discomfort.) If you wish to make an "editorial comment" about the content of the text, you may do so in the written catalog summary, but you may not add it to the recording.Availle wrote:However, I need clarification of what you intend to do with the "extracts" in section 4 - is that a chapter of the whole book or what? If you intend to read bits and pieces here and there, I'll have to run this by the other admins if this is actually allowed in our policy of "don't change the text as it is written". In any case, if this is a gutenberg text, it's better to use the direct link to the gutenberg text without going through archive.
