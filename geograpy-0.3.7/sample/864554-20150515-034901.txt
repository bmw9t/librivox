so we are approaching an exciting milestone in LibriVox activity... we are getting close to having produced a whole year's worth of audio, the point when someone could sit down with our catalog, and start listening, and listen for 8760 hours, or 365 days straight through...only by the time such a listener finished listening, a year later, we'd have produced a whole lot more audio!

In any case, we are currently at:341 days, 13 hours, 50 minutes, and 54 seconds.

Updates to follow!
