Michael,Welcome to Librivox!  Love your voice!  So rich - it's lovely to listen to.Your test is pretty close to perfect.  Technical specs are all good, no noticeable background noise.Your volume is just on the high end . . . Your test is at 91.2 dB and we target 89 dB (87-91 is acceptable).  You have 3 options for measuring the volume on a file:1. There's a small program the spouse of a LibriVoxer developed to check the tech settings. If you're game, you can download it and use it to check the volume and other settings. It's here: http://cgjennings.ca/checker/Use the latest version, which I believe is 0.95. The volume information is in the Information tab. We aim for 89 dB, but anything between about 87 and 91 is good.2. If you want to get all technically cool, someone made a plugin for Audacity that will tell you how much to amplify your recordings. - Click THIS LINK and save the file to your computer - your desktop or somewhere. - Then go to the folder in which Audacity is installed (on my computer, it's in C:\Program Files (x86)\Audacity) and open the Plug-Ins folder.- Drag the file you saved into the Plug-Ins folder. - The next time you start up Audacity, you can highlight your recording, then go to Analyze / ReplayGain, and it'll tell you how much to amplify your file.3. You can use MP3Gain to measure the volume. Don't use it to adjust the volume, though; use Audacity for that. Here's a link: http://download.cnet.com/MP3Gain/3000-2169_4-10175552.htmlI'll mark your thread OK - watch the volume going forward.  Head on over to readers wanted and find something that interests you to work on!MaryAnn
