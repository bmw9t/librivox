Hello,I'm a very new contributor to LibriVox, and I apologize in advance if this information is thoroughly "asked and answered" elsewhere...  I've tried reading through many, many forum posts and this is the exchange that came the closest to addressing my question--though without totally resolving it--so I figured, "Well, let's just pick up this train and see what happens..."I (too) was surprised to find that just twenty of Verne's fifty-four Voyages Extraordinaires had English versions in the LV catalog.  Granted, I'm sure they're not all full of iconic Nemos and Foggs, but Verne's such the quintessential 'Public Domain Author' I was startled to find ANY of his works unrecorded....which led me to wonder: was there maybe a prohibitive reason for these gaps?  What was I missing?  Were the texts unavailable online, were there copyright issues re: translations, etc etc...?  So began my quest.  And as I delved, things did become a bit clearer: only a few of the remaining books are available in English via Project Gutenberg-- and the multiplicity of alternate title translations (and/or use of 'Volume' titling) does obfuscate the search...In any event, I've now tracked down English translations (PD-compliant) for an additional nineteen of the Voyages Extraordinaires.  I thought perhaps if I made links to these texts conveniently available to the community, it might prompt some new recordings (?).  If this is something that would be useful, please let me know the best way to go about it.  Otherwise--or at the very least--I will volunteer to read one myself.  Thanks!
