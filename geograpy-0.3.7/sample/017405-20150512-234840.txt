Hello, Librivox!I'm new and have enjoyed the work of many other volunteers through Librivox's library. I am excited about becoming involved with this great community. Though I love reading books, listening to the human influence on a text lends so much emotion to already great works. I'm a photographer and work from home. I am always looking for ways to break up the day into more palatable sections.  I hope to volunteer as part of that effort.Look forward to working with y'all-Josh
