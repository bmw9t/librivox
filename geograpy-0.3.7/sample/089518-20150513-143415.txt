Welcome, Emory!Yeah, the volume is too low. You should aim for your wave forms to peak near the 0.5 mark, like this:Make sure the microphone slider in the Audacity window is all the way up. Also, have you increased your input volume in Windows yet? Here's a link to instructions: http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/Audacity_1-2-3#VolumeAfter you get your volume up, you'll probably want to run a little noise removal to clean up some of the background white noise. I don't hear much in the file, but when I amplify it I definitely hear it.   Here are a couple resources: text instructions: http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/Noisecleaning_With_Picsvideo: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFSg9o37HMwMy settings are as follows:Noise reduction: 10Sensitivity: 0Frequency Smoothing: 150Attack/decay: 0.03You also have a little bit of DC offset. That is where your base line is above or below the black base line in Audacity. You will have to fix this on every recording you make. To fix, select the entire file and go to Effects / Normalize. Check only the "remove DC offset" box; leave the other one unchecked. Here's more information: http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/Questions_and_Answers#Recording_is_Off-centreThat's it! (Yeah, I know: "Three big things, and she says 'that's it'?" ) Once you get these things under control, you'll do fine.  Try making these adjustments, then post another test. Use the same file name as your previous one, and post in this same thread when it's ready.
