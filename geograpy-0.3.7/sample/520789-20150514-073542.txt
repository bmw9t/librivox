Sandy, thank you for claiming, I've put you down for 13-16.

Phil and Mary, thanks for your chapters and your claim, the MW is updated accordingly.

kalonkakon, your test is good, you're all set! Very nice voice  The only little thing is that your breath hits the mic once in a while, if you are using a headset, try and move it to the side of your mouth so you're not breathing directly into it. It is not really disturbing though, so go ahead and have fun! BTW, I still need to know which name you'd like to use for the catalogue.

Thanks all
