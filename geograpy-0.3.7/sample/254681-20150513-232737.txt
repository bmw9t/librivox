Section 7 is up. I did the rough edit of 8, and I found and inserted the corrected sentence, so that's good to go. I just have to go through it with the text and edit out silences, etc.I recorded a section yesterday (original file 48 minutes; edited version 36 minutes). For the first time ever, I did a hand clap on the errors. I have found, after editing your files, how much faster editing goes when one can do a rough edit by cutting out the errors so quickly! The only downfall I can see is that if I like the emphasis or cadence I used on an earlier try, I lose it to the last take, no matter its quality. But that's a sacrifice I can live with, I think.
