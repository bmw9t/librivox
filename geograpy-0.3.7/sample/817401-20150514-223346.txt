I listen mainly to m4bs on the ipod (the little baby one) and it works fine - I can't see why you couldn't listen to the mp3 files as a book - you would just need to not use the shuffle option - unless it was a very boring book or a collection of short storiesThe advantage of m4bs is that they remember where you stopped , even if you switch to something else. I'm pretty sure you could listen to the mp3s as a podcast - but that is a litttle outside my expertise.Anne
