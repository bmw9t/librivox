Really!  No we do not convert them to stereo - on the contrary, we are more likely to convert from stereo to mono.  There is no real advantage to stereo files for the type of voice recordings we are making and a number of advantages to mono.  You will find a mix of mono and stereo files in the catalog especially in many of the early projects, but we have recently been trying to standardize all the new files to mono (and the new project templates reflect that).
