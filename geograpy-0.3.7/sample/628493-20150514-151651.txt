Thank you, go on being pick. That is OK by me.

We have a saying: The appetite grows while one is eating. and so it is with this reading thing too.
I mean that the demands I put on myself seems to grow all the time. I have for example changed microphone a couple of times, and the editing part takes a lot of time, and so on. But I think it is because I enjoy this "little hobby" so much, and being part of a project that involves such a lot of people from around the world, and thereby want to give it the best I can.
