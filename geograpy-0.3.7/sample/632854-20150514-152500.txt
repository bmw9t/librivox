Chapter X, pt 2 (section 23) uploading now:

http://upload.librivox.org/share/upload ... eetham.mp3  (31:50)

A couple minor things:

1. I just realized that my ID tags are different on my two uploads. The album title on the first one (sect 22) had the "during the first six centuries" part in lower case; the new one has that part in title case like the rest of it. I see on the OP that it had that part in lower case; is that how you want it?

2. I'm thinking of proof-listening some of these sections. It's pretty enjoyable, IMO.
