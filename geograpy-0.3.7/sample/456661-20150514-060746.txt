Hello Stav,
I just wanted to ask if I'm recording the prologue as well. There's approximately seven pages of it before chapter one. I do n't mind, I just wanted to check in case someone else has recorded it but the magic window doesn't even reflect  the existance of said prologue.

All the best,
Sandra.
