Hi everyone! I'm from Argentina. I teach English and literature for a living and I am a very enthusiastic reader. I speak English very fluently, and Spanish, of course. I love reading aloud to my students and also to myself (I try not to get overheard when I do this, 'cause most people don't think it normal), so I'm looking forward to contributing to the project. I can also recommend some Argentine writers in the public domain who might be added.
