Thanks, Amy, for this and for the helpful suggestions on sections. I think the best would be to divide Chapter IV (GENOA AND ITS NEIGHBOURHOOD) into two sections, Chapter X (ROME) into three sections, and Chapter XI (A RAPID DIORAMA) into two sections, thus adding four sections. If you are happy with this, and do the necessary, should I begin one of the relevant sections with "Chapter Four, Part One, of Pictures from Italy â€¦"?And what should I put into the tag of the recording?Anthony
