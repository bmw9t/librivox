Thanks, Barry!    To all I may have offended in the series of posts this morning, I do apologize. Frankly, all the initials (PM) and technicalities were much more than I expected - I guess it was fear of the unknown that made me panic. I'll work on that. I'm happy to be a part of this community. 

Best,
Max
