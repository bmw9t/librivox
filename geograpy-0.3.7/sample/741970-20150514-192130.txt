I have uploaded section 20 to this project's directory on earthcalling's librivox FTP server as:

lifeinathousandworlds_20_harris.mp3

Size: 10.6 MB, Duration: 11:36.


I have recorded my two other sections, 
but have not finished editing. 

I think I made a mistake with the Title ID3 tag on my (previously uploaded) section 15 recording.
Can you please correct it to: 
"15 - A World of Highest Invention" ? 

Thanks, 
Leonie
