*blush*  Than you for the kind words, Mary.  I'm honoured!    And not a problem on the other.  I figure we all have lives outside LibriVox (*gasp!*), and this project is thankfully moving at a leisurely pace.  Which, I'll note, is what's allowing me to keep up!  I'm continuing to peruse possibilities when I can, but I haven't found anything yet so I'm happy to take suggestions.  We'll get there!
