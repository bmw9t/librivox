Bottleneck slide guitar can be wonderfully drifty and meditative, and you don't need to have got very far with basic guitar-playing technique to make beautiful sounds.  I'm really a very basic guitar player (I've learned three tunes by heart, with a little finger picking), but can still make nice sounds with the bottleneck. Slide has the advantage that with the guitar in standard tuning (EADGBE), the top three strings form a minor triad (starting with an open E minor chord), while strings 2-4 form a major chord (starting with G major open). I've noodled around for about 3Â½ minutes, but I'm not sure how to get the recording to you, if anyone would like to listen.  Mediafire seems to have stopped working for me.  May I drop it into our Test folder for a couple of days?Peter
