Downloading the .pdf makes excellent sense for solos! 

Plato's republic has been mentioned in book suggestions because it's one of the top 50 books of all time in the list Hugh found, and LV hasn't cataloged it yet.

The consensus is against the translation available on Gutenberg, but there is a choice of two others on IA.  If the interested volunteers choose a translation from IA, I'm going to offer it as a collab.  Someone who might volunteer for one or two sections would have the choice of the two image formats.

(I did try to edit an OCR scan of another IA book into decent shape, but after spending hours and hours on it, I didn't think the result was good enough.  When that books time comes, I'll be offering the link to the scans as well.)
