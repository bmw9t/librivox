http://upload.librivox.org/share/uploads/phi/adventuresofchatterertheredsquirrel_16_burgess.mp3I didn't put the tags on here, just used the compressor and set it at 14, which Phil suggested, noise floor at -40 because he said so, and ratio 5-1 just because Phil said that's what most people do. I listened and listened to his explanations until my eyes crossed and my brain was still a muddle.My intention was to do the next chapter at 2-1 ratio and then have you pick which one is better. Guess what: my computer put the settings at the same place. Arg, there IS a little man inside there! So, you get both the same.PLEASE do tell me if this is better, OK, better but not good enough yet. Once I get this figured and sit in the same place and talk "the same" it should work most of the time better. Right?   mak--next one coming right up (see I don't even know how to put two in one post) http://upload.librivox.org/share/uploads/phi/adventuresofchatterertheredsquirrel_17_burgess.mp3ARG! Phil is inside my computer! I went to put this in another post and here was my first post. Maybe I didn't push submit. Well now...you get two inside one (sounds like the book one riding in one, two on two, gazillion in one--can't wait for THAT book to be read--guess not, you can't "read" pictures)mak Oh, thanks Phil. I have so many questions about finding my way around that I think I should start all over. Scratch that.One thing--I offered to read something long ago, had a query if I still wanted to, tried to respond in private message, but don't know how to send a private one, and missed the date.    I didn't like that at all. so sorry!
