Yes, a chapter split is just fine.  Warn me if we need another line in the box or anything, and I'll ask kri for one.  I can't believe the length variation in these chapters.  12 min vs well over an hour (not counting the little intro and concluding chapters).

Kara, do you know if there's any way to estimate the word number (and audio length) of a Bartleby chapter?  If it can be done, I might make notes on the remaining chapters so people will be forewarned.
