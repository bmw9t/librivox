Thanks for your recording - I'm glad you enjoy the book.    The book is from 1917. Was the concept of hormones and what they do in the body already known or even thought of? If not, I can see that they knew where the egg came from, but that they thought this was the only function of the ovaries. Clearly, if you remove them outright, there will be physical problems. But was it really known then that menopause was caused by a shutting down of the ovaries? Wouldn't that imply a knowledge of hormones again?
