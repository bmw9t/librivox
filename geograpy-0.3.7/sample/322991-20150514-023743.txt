11 is PL OK In some stories (it was really noticeable in this one), I can hear a clock or a watch ticking.  It doesn't bother me personally... if I were really sitting in your living room listening to you read, then of course I would hear the clock.  But it might bother some listeners, so wanted you to know it is really noticeable in case you want to move away from it in future.
