I would love to be able to read authors from my part of the United States, the Southeast.  Carson McCullers, Truman Capote, Lillian Hellman, William Faulkner, Katherine Anne Porter, Flannery O'Connor, Tennessee Williams, and Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings.  I can speak in a couple of southern accents, particularly if I've spent time with some of my cracker (not an insult) friends and relatives.  It's hard to sustain the drawl on my own though
