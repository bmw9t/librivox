Hi Lars,

Chapter 33 is ready. It runs 16:23.

Gutenberg has a typo in this one. On the first page in the sentence...Not unfrequently there was a convent on the hillside; or, on some insulated promontory, a mined 
castle, once the den of a robber chieftain, who was accustomed to dash
down from his commanding height upon the road that wound below. 
The word "mined" is actually "ruined." I verified this with my book and a scanned source on Google Books/Internet Archive also.

Thanks!
