Hi Monika,Strictly from a listener standpoint; very nice recording.  Sounds like you are working from a studio, and have experience as a narrator.  I just listened to the first part of your recording, as I am pretty well Tom Swifted out.  I am now recording book 15 of the Tom Swift series which I sell on audible.com http://www.audible.com/series/ref=sr_2_2_sa/?asin=B007BIT4ME.  The Tom Swift books are amazingly similar, since they are written to a formula.  40,000 words, and 25 chapters.  Thanks for posting.  Libravox is a wonderful service.Mike
