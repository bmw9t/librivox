Thanks so much for your help, Ruth. She'll be disappointed (again) but better that than getting her hopes up.We'll find her something she likes and wants to record. She seems stuck on recording a novel that has not been recorded yet. Even though I tell her that is not important, she keeps insisting. It's going to be tough.Best,Bob
