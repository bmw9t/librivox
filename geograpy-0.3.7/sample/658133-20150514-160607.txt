Cool! So we're ready to catalog! Yeah! I can't figure out how to edit my id tags. I tried resaving and exporting it, but it doesn't pop up the option to reenter the id tags. Paul, is this something you're able to do? If not, can you explain to me how to do it? Thank you BOTH for your help! Smile Ally
