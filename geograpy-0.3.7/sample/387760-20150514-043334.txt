Hello Simon, I have listened to Chapter 1 and 2, they are word perfect but from time to time I hear a bump, I am thinking that maybe you have bumped the mike.  I have just made note of the first few in the first chapter as you can see them when you open the files in Audacity.  there are some in the first two files.  I am not sure how these can be fixed but the files would be much nicer to listen to if they can be removed..    The files may need noise cleaning, I was told a  rule of thumb is selecting a bit of silence, and click Effects > Amplify. If the number suggested is 50, then it should be OK. If less than 50, then it might need noisecleaning.I will get more of the sections listened to tomorrow, I have had some unexpected company here!  Mim@ 1:07 Then Daniel Caldigate had been alone.Here there is a bump like you bumped the mike ??@ 6:14 And there are straight roads and straight dikes, with ugly names on all sides, and passages through the country called droves, also with ugly appellations of their own, which certainly are not worthy of the name of roads.Another bit of a bump here @ 6:59 But when they had last taken their departure from Folking, no one had entertained any idea of any peculiar relations between the nephew and the uncle.Bump@ 10:18 But still he had hated the thing, and as years rolled on he came to think that the entail now existing would do an especial evil.Bump
