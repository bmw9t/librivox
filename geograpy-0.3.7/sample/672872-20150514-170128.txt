Thanks for the vote of confidence, David.

The recording was made with a check reader (which I've found is no guarentee of total accuracy), so hopefully there will not be any fixing necessary.

Just as a side note, the reason I thought to submit my recording to determine if the quality was acceptable, is that one of the few recordings I've listened to is Glen Hallstrom (SmokestackJones), and I thought -- Sheeeze -- if I have to reder THAT kind of professionalism and talent I may as well just take up turnip farming.
