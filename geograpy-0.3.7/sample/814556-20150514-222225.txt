You'll get a lot of different opinions . . . but I think a lot of short sections (and I'm thinking that less than about 5 minutes is "short") get tedious to listen to because every sections starts with the disclaimer.  When I read Anna Karenina, I broke each chapter into a separate section . . . and that made for some short sections because there were some short chapters.  I have done other projects where I combined short chapters to get to at least 20 minute sections so that the disclaimer didn't come up so often.As a listener, I also like 20-30 minute chunks to listen to.MaryAnn
