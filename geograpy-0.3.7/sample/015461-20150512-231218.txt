Welcome to Librivox Kristjan   The place to start is the Newbie Guide to Recording, which tells you how to set up your computer to record. Once you've done that, you can post a short test recording in the Listeners & Editors Wanted section of the forums. This is NOT an audition, but a way to check to make sure all your technical settings are correct, your volume loud enough, etc. Some neat video guides are available here:http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/Video_Guidesor here...http://www.youtube.com/user/cajun5454#g/u
