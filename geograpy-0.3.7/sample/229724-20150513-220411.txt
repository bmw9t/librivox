OK, we are ready for customers!  This is a book that was recommended by ChuckW, who will also be our DPL!  (Thanks Chuck!)  This book was written in response to people saying that Hollywood was a horrible and wretched place because of some scandals of the day.  And the book was also made into a silent movie in 1923!  There are a lot of chapters, but they are relatively short, the longest was about 8-10 pages, the shortest 1 1/2 pages, so this should be an easy read for everyone!  We will stay here for a day or 2, just to get some exposure.  So come on in, the pool is fine!
