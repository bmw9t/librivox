Well, I have found it. 

The link isn't clickable because it has spaces in the file name, but it is this:

http://upload.librivox.org/share/uploads/xx/english_a method of a cloak_stein_cc.zip

EDIT: I have changed the file name to

http://upload.librivox.org/share/upload ... ein_cc.zip

I downloaded it, and it consists of:

A Mac OSX folder
A Mac OSX file of some description
and a file called english_a method of a cloak_stein_cc.mov

That's as far as I can go as I'm not a Mac user. However, I can say that it isn't an MP3 file.
