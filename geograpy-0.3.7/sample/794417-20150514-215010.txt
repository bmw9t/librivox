If I may add to the cover discussion, I do mine in Illustrator.  I have a template that is 4.75" x 4.75" (rather than dpi) and this exports nicely to the Word cover template.  I have Illustrator set to export to 150dpi, so my resized covers (resized in PhotoShop) come out to 2" square while my thumb cover comes out 1" square.  I think this helps keep the file size low.  For the PDF, I just have Word print to a PDF, so it's more or less standard compression.  When I first started, I had Illustrator export at 300dpi, and this made my PDF's much larger...Don't know if this helps anyone, but it works for me!    Thanks so much,Janette
