Thank you Amy and Mary.

Amy, I listened to a part of this and there is some problem with your mic I think.  The sound keeps fluctuating in and out.  I tried to use the leveler on the recording but it did not help much.  Can you please check your microphone and the connections to see if something might be loose or dirty.
