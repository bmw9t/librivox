Well.... I have May off. I attended graduation on May 6, and then I finished a paper we sent off to try to get it published, went to a conference... but I have not been sewing, which is what I usually do a lot of in my spare time. I have not much wanted to do that recently though - I go in cycles. I'll do that for a while, then do this, then paint, then sew... 

But yeah, this is fast becoming one of my most satisfying ways to spend my spare time, instead of playing video games on the internet.
