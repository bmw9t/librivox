Oh Ruth, you are my sunshine etc. I think you know what my reply to the burning desire will be. That chapter gave me the worst recording sessions I have ever had. I've also learned some valuable lessons from some extremely painful mistakes. Well I exagerate slightly, I'm over it now. I certainly have no wish to re-record any of it! Thanks so much for making it unnecessary. I re-listened to chapter fifteen a few minutes ago and I have to say that I was worried that it would sound like a patch-work-quilt after the amount of mistakes I made but, unless you were really listening out, and knew where they all were, they don't jump out from behind trees at you at all! Thanks again.  If I had had to do the editing for myself, I don't think I'd still be recording here. I don't know how you can stand it although I'm pretty grateful that you can.

By the way, I keep meaning to ask you this and forget each time. How do I download the finished, polished article to have on my computer? All I've got is the pauseriphic, spluttering versions on here. Grounding as that is, I wouldn't mind having the nice ones too.
All the best,
Sandra.
