I would put some of them together, but I have out of town guests coming on Thursday and probably won't be able to do anything like this until after the 4th. Someone else could, if they're willing, or maybe I could do it for #118. When is the due date for #118 again? I see this one is Oct 31.Bloopers, right! Bloopers are always fun. The deadline for show #118 would be Friday, Nov 18.  That would be neat if you could put one together, Tricia!Thanks!Bob
