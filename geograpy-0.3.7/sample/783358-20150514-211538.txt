I've started recording Mary E. Wilkins Freeman's "The Shadows on the Wall" in this collection: http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/15143 ... but I've been having trouble with Audacity (it just stops functioning in the middle of the recording!), so I've had to record the last third of this story about 4 times...but I'll keep trying =)
