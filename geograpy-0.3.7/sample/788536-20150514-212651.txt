Thanks, got that.
I notice you're yet another Logitech USB proponent.
I've just purchased one tonight on E-Bay so I'm hoping it helps cut down some of that background hiss.
I recently put the two parts I'd done on to my MP3 player and let them play through.
I also had Pride and Prejudice on there and the comparison was heartbreaking.
Previously I was thinking, yup, that sounds OK, that's acceptable quality.
Then Pride and Prejudice came on and illusions were shattered.
The sound was sharp, distinct and with no background to distract the listener from the words.

So, as a result, I'm going to re-record them with another michrophone (when it arrives) and see if I can get an improved recording.
