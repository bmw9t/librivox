Hi Jim,Just noticed the title ID3 tags of your files - because of the combining of chapters in sections, they are getting a bit confusing perhaps for listeners.At present they are something like:Quote:01 - Preface and Chapter 102 - Chapter 203 - Chapter 304 - Chapter 405 - Chapter 5 and 607 - Chapter 708 - Chapter 809 - Chapter 9 and 1011 - Chapter 1112 - Chapter 12This might make an unsuspecting listener worry that they are missing section 06 and 10 etc.So I was thinking how we could avoid that - either:Quote:01 - Preface and Chapter 102 - Chapter 203 - Chapter 304 - Chapter 405 - Chapter 5 and 606 - Chapter 707 - Chapter 808 - Chapter 9 and 1009 - Chapter 1110 - Chapter 12etcThis would keep the numbering consistent with the mp3 filenames, but that might also get confusing with the different numbers in the title tags.Also possible would be:Quote:01 - Preface and Chapter 102 - Chapter 203 - Chapter 304 - Chapter 405 and 06 - Chapter 5 and 607 - Chapter 708 - Chapter 809 and 10 - Chapter 9 and 1011 - Chapter 1112 - Chapter 12and also consider then to change the mp3 titles to e.g. whitejacket_05_06_melville.mp3 so that they match(That all doesn't matter as long as  you make sure the files will sort properly on mp3 names as well as on ID3 tags - some players use the one, others the other).See what I mean? It's not a major issue, but something to consider. Personally, I would opt for something like the last option.Oh - and there is no need to update it in the individual files. There is a neat tool in the behind-the-scenes cataloguing software that I use in the end: it can take the "title" column and copy that as ID3 title tag to each individual file. Very neat especially with so many files that can have typos etc. I'm afraid the software might not like the <B> tags however. So once you decide on a numbering scheme all you have to do is make sure the MW is the way you want it, and I'll be able to fix all the files in the end.(I can also pretty easily fix mp3 names in that software, so no need to change those one by one by reuploading).Hope I've explained it a bit clearly? Good progress, by the way!Anna
