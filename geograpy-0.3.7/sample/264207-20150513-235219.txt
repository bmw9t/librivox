Time for a new fortnightly already?   So runs the world away! - Oh, fresh posts clarify my muddled sense of time!  Suspicious of that "of" in the third line, I found the Gutenberg version online with some minor differences that look more plausible:Quote:Nature, the gentlest mother,    {no "is"}Impatient of no child,The feeblest or the waywardest, —Her admonition mildIn forest and the hillBy traveller is heard,Restraining rampant squirrelOr too impetuous bird.How fair her conversation,A summer afternoon, —Her household, her assembly;And when the sun goes downHer voice among the aislesIncites the timid prayerOf the minutest cricket,The most unworthy flower.When all the children sleepShe turns as long awayAs will suffice to light her lamps;Then, bending from the skyWith infinite affectionAnd infiniter care,Her golden finger on her lip,Wills silence everywhere.
