This might not be the right part of the forum, but I'm posting to multiple places in hopes of getting a good reading out of it.

Part ?, as read by ?, is almost completely ?
Someone else MUST re-record his portions ?, as the pronunciations are very incomprehensible and almost completely incorrect (I'm talking simple words, mind you, not even talking character names).

It seems this readers accent is so strong that most of the words are pronounced incorrectly, but I've known many different people from around the world, and this truly sounds like deliberate mispronunciations rather than forgivable accent dialect differences.  The pronunciation errors go beyond mere dialect.

Please don't take my word for it.  Listen for yourself.  Oh, and to lend credibility, "Fr. Richard Zeile of Detroit"'s reading was acceptable, ?but at least his pronunciation is correct.

And "Beecher"'s reading was EXCELLENT.
