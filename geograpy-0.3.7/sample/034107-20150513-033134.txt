Hi Gary!  It's perfectly ok to leap in with a huge solo project.  We do see a lot  of newbies who start massive solos but aren't really aware of how much work it is, and then tend to give up and drift away, which makes us sad.  That's why we encourage people to start small.

But -- we also encourage people to do what they love!  And if what you really want is to read Mohicans go right ahead.  Might be good to get some quick feedback on a short sample recording.  It's no fun to find you have to re-do a chapter because of a funny buzzing sound in the background. 

If you're brimming with confidence, go read the "Sticky" in the Going Solos section and get started :)

Have fun, and welcome to LibriVox!
