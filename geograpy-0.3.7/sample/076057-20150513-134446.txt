This looks like a fun project.  I'm very new (just two days ago!) to LibraVox and while I'm anxious to start an entire book on my own, I will take the advice I was given and get some experience on a project like this one.I'm not fussy as to which story I read.  You may pick one for me if you like.  Or if you'd rather I pick one myself, I can do so at random. Hamlet
