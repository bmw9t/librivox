Hi, Barry, & everyone! 

I'm still here, so don't worry. You're all doing a marvelous job with your parts. I had some down time during the holidays (was fairly worn out), but I'm back now & have started doing some of the PL'ing.

Barry, your parts are great! They were short so easy to check first. 

Bob, chap. 1 is PL OK! You're doing a great job---I haven't heard you read before (I'm still discovering great readers here), & I'm really enjoying listening to you!  There is one word that needs to be deleted from your re-recorded version of the Preface. At 2:59 you say "which" after "novel"; & it seems to change author's meaning. Here's the sentence: "And is a book 'suitable for a boy of twelve' any more likely to please a boy of twelve than a modern novel is likely to please a man of thirty-seven; even if the novel be described truly as 'suitable for a man of thirty-seven'?" So just delete "which" & it'll be PL OK! Thanks! (I'll do a quick spot-check after you fix that.) I'll be PL'ing chap. 2 soon (& looking forward to more! You're an excellent reader with a very pleasant voice---& I can be picky about voices sometimes). 

I have PL'ed some other character lines, but I've misplaced my folder with my notes (duh!   ) so I need to re-listen (&, of course, listen to parts I haven't yet). Things were hectic over the holidays & took a lot out of me, & I've been resting up since. 

But this is such a fun book & I think it'll be fantastic when it's done! I'm really enjoying it! 

Happy New Year, everyone! And, Barry, big congratulations on becoming an admin!  Awesome!  The other admins made an excellent choice! (As long as you continue to be kind to us "peasants." Hmm, do I need to bow or curtsey to you now?   )

Joy
