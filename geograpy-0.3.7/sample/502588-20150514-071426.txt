Starlite beat me to it - I'm happy for you to start reading - remember to leave the time at the end with the mic running so we can maybe do a little noise cleaning if needed and maybe see if you can get enough volume if you move the mic a little to the side of your mouth so that air goes past it not in , - if you notice on words like text you have a wobbly wave pattern which causes a thumpy sound
Nice voice and reading , looking forward to your recording
