I'm leaning in that direction myself, mostly because I hate closing off projects from European readers.  As far as I know, Hughes didn't use ghost-writers.  Unlike his far more infamous nephew Howard, Rupert was a legitimate author (to the best of my knowledge) and was widely read in the early twentieth-century.
