The problem was that we usually go by what gutenberg lists as the author and in this case that didn't seem to agree with the general consensus.  However, I see the gutenberg text you've linked to doesn't appear to be the translation by F. E. Bunnett but rather a retelling for children.  Is that what you were looking for or did you want the Bunnett translation?  It's here: http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/3714 and it's spelled with one e.

And one more question, do you plan to read the intro as a separate file or as part of chapter 1?
