Hello Andres.. and welcome to LibriVox!

It's good that you've listened to a few of our recordings, so you should have some idea of what LibriVox recordings sound like.  If you're wanting to record yourself, it's usually a good idea to start with something short, so you can learn how the process works.  Poetry is always good for this purpose, and we've got two main collections for that: the Weekly Poetry, where several people read a pre-selected poem, or the Short Poetry Collection, where you can record any poem of your choice (that's not copyrighted) to add to the collection.  

Well, good luck, and see you around!
