Hi Linny,I have completed chapter two (The Supercilious Attache) and I PRAY its right.  I finally got everything working...my concern is that there was a huge range of sound....the Cantankerous Old Lady was always louder then the other 'voices', so I aimed to try for a middle volume....hope that was allright.I'm having tons of trouble uploading it.  It says its connecting...but nothing seems to be happening.  I shall keep on trying.  Anyway.  The file ends at 50:55.   Let me know your thoughts.    Barbara
