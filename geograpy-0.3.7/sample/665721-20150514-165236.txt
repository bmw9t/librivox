Actually, I did check the Gutenberg link, just to make sure I didn't have the wrong text, and the HTML link on Gutenberg (right under the ReadMe link) is the same as what's in the MW.  So I think we can blame the ReadMe link for this one.   Sorry it didn't work out, but I won't mind listening to it again.
