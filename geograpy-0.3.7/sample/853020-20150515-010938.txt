i have a separate (huge) harddrive for all my librivox stuff, including the .aup files from all my old recordings and backups of (most of the) projects i've mc'ed. i am one of the readers who has had to re-record and edit several sections because her computer crashed and there was no backup, so i highly recommend backing up your files (and your system in general) regularly
