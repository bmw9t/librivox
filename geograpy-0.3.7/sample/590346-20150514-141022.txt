Hi Rachel,

Don't know what all you changed but that sounds great.     There is just a small bit of hum in the background that I could hear only if I used my headphones; I could not hear it if using my desk speakers.  It may be your built in microphone picking up the computer hum.  Definitely not anything to worry about though, so start recording.  

And again, your reading is wonderful.  Keep that up!  I tend to talk too fast and have to keep reminding myself to slow down.  PL'ing other peoples files is a great way to learn things, too.  You hear the good things they do and you also learn what to watch out for.  Not to mention it is another part of the process that needs to be done to get a book cataloged.  And if it is a book you would enjoy listening to, you can sign on as the Designated Proof Listener (DPL) and you get to hear the whole thing.  I am kinda surprised someone has not offered to do that here yet but think I am just gonna do it myself since I would listen to this whole thing anyway.  (Mary, can you take care of that in the MW please?)

You probably saw where Neeru (neerajanagarajan) suggested trying to do this as a dramatic work too so I am looking into that.  Might want to join us for that if I get it going.

Well, as I said, your recording sounded great so start in on your chapters and have FUN.  Let me know if you need any help.  And remember, I'll be listening.      (Just teasing   )
