Or just the whole book in whichever language you prefer as a solo... or some of the stories in the Multilingual or German Short Works and some here ... or any combination! However you do it, the stories will be searchable in the catalogue, so really however you would prefer to do it .OK, since you don't have a preference, I'll just do the German one as a solo and leave the English one here as a suggestion... best read by someone American (there is no info on the translator). Thanks for the quick feedback!
