This looks like it might be a good Club to join. Some questions (sorry):

1. How do we read entries where two or more words are bracketed together and synonyms provided for both e.g. p.8, Acroamatic and Acroamatical?
2. Do you want us to read capitalised synonyms (which are presumably cross-references to other entries in the Dictionary) in a special way?
3. How do we read a parenthetical definition which is used to show the particular shade of meaning being used e.g. p.8 Act, n. 1. Deed (viewed as a single exertion of power)?
4. An abbreviation not in your list used in brackets as in my question 3. (Law) e.g. p.8 Action 7. (Law)?
