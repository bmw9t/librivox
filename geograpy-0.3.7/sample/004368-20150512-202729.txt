Hello to everybody here with librivoxI'm 49 years old, female, have a big family and like to read and to listen to audiobooks. A few month ago I told my husband, that one of my greatest desires would be to make a record of an audiobook by myself. And last week, when I visited your website, I saw that it would be possible to do that from my computer at home. So I checked in and I look forward to read a chapter of a book one day. Sorry for my bad english! Hope that somebody understands what I wanted to say...   I'm happy to be with You!Greetings from Dorothee (dodo64)
