Hey Judy

Rainer is away for a week and I'm looking after his projects. Well done for doing these last two chapters! Rainer will start cataloguing when he comes back (please keep your chapters on your hard drive until he confirms that he has really received them through the uploader), and will also then let you know if he needs anything else.

What is likely to happen is that he will 

1) open a proof-listening thread for you in the Listeners Wanted forum (or you could do so yourself if you wish - it that case, read the FAQ there, please) to catch repeats, overlong pauses etc - the little things we miss in editing our own files.

2) ask you how you would like to appear in the LibriVox catalogue (name and URL, if you wish)

3) ask you if you would like to write a short summary of the novel for our catalogue page.

If you like, you could post re 2) and 3) and then Rainer has it for when he gets back. :)

Congratulations again for completing this book, Judy! :) And we're glad you're doing another almost straight away!
