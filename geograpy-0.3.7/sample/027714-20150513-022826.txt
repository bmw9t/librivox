I'm originally from the US but have been living in Japan for over 15 years now. My pronunciation is not as strong as it used to be before moving here.  If and when I do speak English, it tends to be a version that makes it easy for Japanese speakers to understand.  Anyway, this will force me to work on my English again...and get back in touch with my LOVE of reading!!  Please feel free to offer any advice, as it is much appreciated.

Stay healthy, happy and blessed...
