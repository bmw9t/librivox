I have had a hard time trying to get rid of the plosives and other extraneous sounds from my mouth.  I think the ones that are left in the recording shouldn't be too problematic, but let me know, and I can try to get particular ones out.

I also tried Normalize, as Kehinde suggested, and it seems to have helped with the volume fluctuations.  Again, if there's something that needs to be fixed there, I can try to sort it out.

It was fun reading this project!
