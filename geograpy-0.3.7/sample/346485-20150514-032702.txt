Thank you Leni and Elli! Let's do it! Oh, I didn't realise until after I grabbed the summary off of google and pasted it: They were just using it from the fore-ward of the actual book itself. I don't know if the fore-ward was by the brother or husband, etc. of the translator but he had the same last name. Would that make it public domain? (Switching the URL, of course.)I'm planning on being a bit more plain in my reading as the characters are quite numerous, and it's a kids book. (The reader of Heidi lending some inspiration there.)And OH MY GOSH! Thank you for making the fore-ward section #0! That is so helpful! I was worried about getting the numbering mixed up in contrast to the chapter numbers! *relief*
