Quote:Whenever the narrator says something like this:[Takes the watch, looks at it gloomily, dips it into his cup of tea and looks at it again but doesn’t know what else to say.]She adds a "The March Hare" or "The Dormouse" etcYes, that's how it's supposed to be so we know what's going on, but thanks for mentioning it! Quote:At this line:March Hare and HatterThen the Dormouse shall. Wake up Dormouse.The Hatter only joins in for a bit of "wake up dormouse" Fixed! @ 6:02Quote:CatWhy, about you! And if he left off dreaming about you, where do you suppose you’d be? @ 15:53Quote:In this line, Tweedledee says "The moon was shining" instead of:DeeThe sun was shining— PMed about this because it was moon instead of sun.Quote:The words in Tweedledees line that are in bold were left out:Dee“It seems a shame,” the Walrus said,“To play them such a trick,After we’ve brought them out so far,And made them trot so quick!”  the "such" was actually in there, but the "out" wasn't. I didn't think that big enough to ask her to redo for. I just asked her about the first line. EDIT: Charlotte gave me that line and it's added in at 18:47 Quote:The Queen misses the first sentence of this line:QueenCut it off. Cut them all off! Added it in @ 32:07 Quote:Last note: The space at the end of the recording is a bit longer than five seconds Anything over 30 mins is supposed to be 10 seconds long. It was a tiny bit longer so I snipped that. So the only thing I'm missing is Charlottes line and then we'll be good to go! I'll wait for you to spot check when we get that line in.
