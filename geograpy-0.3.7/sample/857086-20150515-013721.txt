Quote:do you think there is a case for adding a list to the "discontinued Solist or projects needing a BC " in book suggestions for these type of things so a BC looking for an idea might pick them up.Well, they're not discontinued projects - they were never started. However, I wouldn't be averse to a thread listing all the ones that need final volumes finished up.
