Hello,

some of you i know must be at least a bit curious of what is happening there.

I loved pdsounds. I struggled for a year with the decision, again and again i couldn't get over with it but I finally canceled the web-hosting for pdsounds in march when finalising the deal to buy a house with my beloved made the decision easier. Now i would need the money, and several free hosters i asked to step in, turned me down or never answered. More importantly it became clear that the lot of sound recording people share elsewhere. You might think 620 sounds in two years, thats a good ratio - two sounds per day - other sites would dream of that participation. But it isn't like that. There'd been times when 4 weeks would pass by before another post was made. Aside from short wonderful rushes of contagious inspiring participation, pdsounds limped most of the time of the year. Which made comming to a decision so hard, again and again the question - isn't there a possibilty...? BUT family first. Webhosting cancelled.

Then Mike Koenig emailed me, offered me to continue pdsounds.org in good interest. Turns out he is a nice guy. He likes to use the traffic and googlescore of pdsounds to give his other free-sound related sites a lift. Clever! Sponsoring this established rescource to round-link to his related sites is inexpansice and good SEO. I am happy to see pdsounds going on providing its free sounds to downloaders, many of you recorded and uploaded, for a good while longer. How long Mike is planning to keep pdsounds up, i don't know.

That's the story. It works again but I wouldn't upload any sounds, pdsounds is a patient with a medically induced coma.
I suggest you grab what you can while you can. At best download the archive of all the sounds here: and keep them on a cdrom somewhere.
