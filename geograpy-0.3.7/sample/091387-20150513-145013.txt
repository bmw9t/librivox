Hello! Welcome to Librivox Tech specs are correct    Your volume is a bit on the soft side. Let's try to bring it up a bit. Check if you can increase input volume of your microphone, either from the microphone slider in Audacity, or from the sound/microphone control panel of your system, so that when you record, the waveform peaks just above the 0.5 mark (and not too much higher). Alternatively, if those are maxed out, you can amplify in Audacity after recording.Also note that at the beginning the first sentence is cut off. Maybe this was a one-time occurence, but if there's always a delay from when you click the record button till it actually starts recording, you should wait that time and start reading a bit later. You can then trim the beginning silence if needed to about 0,5 - 1 second.Would you like to try another recording to check the volume again? Please ask if there are questions
