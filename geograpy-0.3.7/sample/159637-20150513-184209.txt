Hi there,Actually, I'm using Adobe Audition and I thought I had changed the track to mono.  This software doesn't easily change WAV sounds to mp3 either.  I just know how to do basic things with this software, but I'll pay closer attention to the technical aspects in future.  I'd be really grateful to get a few technical tips if there's anybody out there who's familiar with this software.Thanks a lot.Crossandra
