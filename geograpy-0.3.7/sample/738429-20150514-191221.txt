According to the publishing history, this is book #2 in the Pax/Astra series, of which The Stars Are Ours! is the first - unfortunately, not in Gutenberg's library (at present).  I've read the plot and the first chapter, and I don't think that listeners will miss much, as the first book covers getting to Astra, hundreds of years before the events of this book.
