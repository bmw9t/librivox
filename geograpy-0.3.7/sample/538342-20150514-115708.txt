Only problem is that the file is in Stereo not Mono

I don't use Garageband but I knew I had seen how to make it Mono somewhere so hunted it down

Quote:When you go to export your recording, select share, and then the options menu pops up. For audio settings, select "Custom", and another window will pop-up - that's where you select mono.

hope this works for you

Otherwise the file was fine
