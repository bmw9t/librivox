Hi, Chris!

Just checking in here, and I'm sorry to hear things are so rough.  I hope the new medication does wonders for you and that your move goes smoothly and you enjoy your new place.

I really love the stuff you've done for LibriVox, but don't push yourself to do more if don't feel up to it.

Thanks so much and best of luck!

K
