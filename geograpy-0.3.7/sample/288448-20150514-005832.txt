I am honored  you chose this project to do your first recording and you may certainly have section 8.  In fact it is a perfect first section; short but packed full of great words.    Please read the first post that tells  you how to name the file and stuff.  upload to my folder. And ask lots of questions if you got 'em.   I also have many videos about naviating our forums, editing with Audacity and other fun topics.   the link is in my signature.   Have Fun!   (I'm so excited to have you here my propeller is spinning)
