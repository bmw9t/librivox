Hello!I am a newbie from Hawaii.  I recently finished the Honolulu Marathon in December- which was quite a feat for me considering I'm not really a "runner".  I was always incredibly bored by the time an hour approached (which is not a great start for someone hoping to finish a marathon).  I decided that if I was going to do this I needed a little motivation....which is where my discovery of Librivox.org comes in.  Throughout my training I listened to Pride and Prejudice, Bram Stoker's Dracula, and The Last of the Mohicans.  I found myself looking forward to the runs, if only to find out what happened in the next chapter.  Without Librivox I would have never made it!Although I have never had any public speaking experience, I thought would be great to be able to give back and volunteer by doing some reading myself. I love reading books to little kids (and always thought I had an excellent children's-book reading voice), but the thought of reading a classic book to thousands of adult listeners is somewhat terrifying.  We'll see if I get my nerve up.  Hopefully if I'm just terrible someone will have the heart to tell me, "Hey, thanks for trying, we appreciate the good effort! We will no longer require your services here." And without any regrets I will quietly slip to the other side of the microphone.  That if someone would be so kind to give me the axe. Aloha!
