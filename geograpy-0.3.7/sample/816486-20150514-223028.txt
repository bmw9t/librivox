I use Ubuntu.After following Jo's advice and finding something that I want to listen to, I right-click and choose "Save Link As ..." which opens a dialogue box asking me where on my computer I want the file.  If it's going to be a quick listen I save it to my Desktop.  If it's a whole book, I create a folder on my desktop and save it into there.You can use the right-click option on the "Download" button or on any individual clickable link that shows up.
