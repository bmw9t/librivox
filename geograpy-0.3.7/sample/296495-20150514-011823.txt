And that's a wrap!http://upload.librivox.org/share/uploads/ba/sinsofhollywood_11_roberts.mp3(Hope you enjoy the RIDICULOUS accents!)This chapter, FYI, is pretty significant... although it doesn't seem so at first.  It's a takedown on Universal co-founder Julius Stern, who was know for... this sort of behavior.  Full disclosure: I am also writing about this chapter (and the "Strip Poker" chapter) for an ongoing research project.I'm glad to be finished with this one.  I'd originally envisioned this as a down-and-dirty project that could be finished relatively quickly.  But the loss of my hard drive made it quite the opposite.  I wound up having to record several of these files multiple times.I'm going to launch another Hollywood-related solo project in the next couple of days.  Something a little less salacious, I promise.
