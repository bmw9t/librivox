Hmm... The New York Times and other publications used here are also still in print.  They also charge you if you want access to one of the articles in their archive.  (Unless you get if for free at a University.)  I think the difference might be that there is no intention on my part to use the 'print' version of their publication.  It's up for proof-reading purposes only.  Once that's finished, there will not be a text link for this article in LibriVox.  I've done the same for New York Times articles.
