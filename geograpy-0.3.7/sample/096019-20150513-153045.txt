Al,Stopping by to mark your test OK. I agree with Masa-san that your test meets all the requirements - just watch the volume that you don't go any higher.  It sounds to me like your microphone or computer may have some sort of noise canceling feature enabled.  If you can shut that off, you'll find noise cleaning with Audacity is gentler on your voice.MaryAnn
