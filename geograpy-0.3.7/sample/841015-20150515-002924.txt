There are two main ways of pronouncing Latin, the 'restored' which is an attempt to pronounce it in the way that Cicero did, and the 'Italian' which imitates the usage of the Catholic church. The 'restored' pronunciation would be 'condiskipuli' [stress 'skip'], and the Italian would be 'condishipuli'[stress 'ship']. I use the 'restored', but I think the Italian sounds nicer. The vowels would be as in Italian in both cases, so 'i' sounds more like 'ee' to anglophone ears.So Cicero, Sissero in English, pronounced his own name as 'Kickero', and is 'Chichero' in Italy, where, disguised as 'cicerone'['chicherone'] he's become a travel guide. Was Henry Esmond a 'Sir' ? If he was, 'com.' could stand for 'comes' which could mean 'knight'. hefyd
