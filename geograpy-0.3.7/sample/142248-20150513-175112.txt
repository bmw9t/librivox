Great John.  For section 1, put the time in the "notes" section and change the status to "ready for PL".As to finding a DPL, you can post in the "listeners wanted" forum.  There is a FAQ here:  viewtopic.php?f=21&t=17680The template for the advert is here:  http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/ProofListening_TemplateOnce you post, an admin will come along and Lock your post (to force people to post in the project thread) and make it sticky (so that it stays at the top of the forum until you find a PLer).MaryAnn
