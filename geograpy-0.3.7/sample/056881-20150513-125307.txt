Thank you for the compliment! I have been told (only a couple times) that I am too picky.  I find those comments painful.  I try very hard to mention ONLY those errors that change the meaning, not the little unimportant ones.  I base my judgments on whether the error confuses my understanding of the story.  Your appreciation makes me feel my efforts are valuable.And (just FYI) I'm gaining new knowledge from this book, an understanding of the classifications of animals that I did not have and have often wished for.Thanks again,Maxine    (very, very happy)
