Thanks Tricia, I chopped off the last part of the summary so as not to give away the plot. I never thought about that, just always pasted whatever Wikipedia had.

I am going to take a break for the holidays and start some other creative projects that have been on my back burner. Tom, I will look you up when I'm ready for my next solo. Aren't you going to make me change the "remembers"?
