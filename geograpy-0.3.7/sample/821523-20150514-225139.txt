I would say that one solution is as you say - move away a bit from the mic on the louder character, and closer on the others. Or is there a way to make the one character more intense instead of just louder? Regarding the crackle: it might be humidity in your connection, it may be moving a wire, it may be something else. I think the only thing you can do about it (besides try not to move your wire) is either try to delete it or re-record the phrase.
