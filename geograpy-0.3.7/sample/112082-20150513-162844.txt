Just a quick update to let you know that I haven't abandoned my fixes!I'm having a bit of trouble getting my tracks to blend without a click at 1:24-1:30 where I have two sections running parallel...(any advice on this problem would be great)I'm heading up to the bush for work, but I will hopefully get that last thing ironed out when i'm back in two weeks.Thanks for the patience!
