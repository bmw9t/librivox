I know that the way things work is that people volunteer for certain chapters, and that if it isn't in for a certain amount of time, or if he or she can't do it for another reason others can volunteer for that chapter, but what if we have something in which multiple people volunteer for a section, then people vote on whose version to use? Would help keep quality readings on librivox!
