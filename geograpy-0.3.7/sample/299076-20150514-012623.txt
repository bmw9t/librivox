Any pointers welcome, although I see there are already tons of helpful guides posted on the forum!Hello MennoVoice and welcome to Librivox! !!  Happy to have a Mennonite on board!!  I am always happy to welcome new readers, and I thank you for volunteering but it appears that this is your first post here at Librivox.  Since this is the case, I ask that before you volunteer to read a section, you first submit a short, 30 second or so, recording to our ‘Listeners and Editors Wanted’ forum.  This is not an audition!  It is merely a way get you familiar with the recording, editing and submission process, and get the technical kinks worked out.  Once that is finished, I can assign you to read sections from this book.Please read our Newbie Guide to Recording to learn about downloading the appropriate software and how to submit a test recording for Librivox.http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/Newbie_Guide_to_RecordingThanks again, and I am looking forward to your future recordings here!
