Apparently I'm following the saying "What you can put off till tomorrow, don't do today"  so I didn't leave feedback yesterday   Just kidding!Well, everything is in order with your recording set-up: Tech specs correct, volume nicely at 90dB, and clear from background noise/plosives/etc... You're ready for the Readers Wanted! Have fun!
