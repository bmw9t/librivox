OK, readers, take note: even though the play is not divided into acts or scenes, we're going to be dividing the script in half (or nearly).  Part One will end with these lines of the narrator's:

[BALLET.â€”The farm folk enter in holiday dress with flowers in their hats, a fiddler in the lead. They carry a keg of home-brewed beer and a smaller keg of gin, both decorated with greens which are placed on the table. They help themselves to glasses and drink. Then they sing and dance a country dance to the melody of "There came two ladies out of the woods." When that is over they go out, singing.]

Part Two will begin with these lines of the narrator's:

[Enter Julie alone, sees the havoc the visitors have made, clasps her hands, takes out powder box and powders her face. Enter Jean exuberant.]

Please submit two files per role: you can simply say "Part One" and "Part Two" at the beginning of each, and label your files this way: countessjulie_[role]_#.mp3.

Narrator, please make sure to say "End of Part One" and "End of Part Two" as part of your recordings.

Any questions - please let me know!
