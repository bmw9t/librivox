The Adventures of Doctor Whitty (1913) by George A Birmingham (1865-1950)http://www.archive.org/details/advofdrwhitty00birmiala14 humorous short stories with a twist, loosely connected, about the wiles of Dr Whitty - a doctor in a small Irish town, who likes to plot & plan to get his way. I bought this in a second-hand bookstore, always on the lookout for more PD works for LV of course! On return home, I found out that the author had lived to the fine old age of 85 - and so would not be PD for me to record until 2021... But I highly recommend it for non-European readers.
