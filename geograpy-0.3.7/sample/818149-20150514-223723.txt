Once you have a bit of experience , when you make a mistake you pause, and read the whole phrase again and that means you just cut out the errorWithout doing this - there comes a point where it is easier to re read than to fix the errors,So like most things about recording you have to decide which is best for you.Try a small bit so you can see how much you need to do and how hard it is , then make up your mind.
