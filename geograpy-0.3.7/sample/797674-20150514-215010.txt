I notice the cover art for Sword Blades and Poppy Seed, (recently uploaded by Annie, I believe), shows up in my iTunes library and Podcast ap. This shows it can be done.  How did you make that happen? I hope ya'll can figure this out and we can start to duplicate it.  Could it be a file size issue?  What else was different about this cover?
