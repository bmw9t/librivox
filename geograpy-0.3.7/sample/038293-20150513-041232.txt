Hello folks, allow me to introduce myself. I have qquite an odd username and there is a story behind it. It is to honor a man that I think is one of the greatest civil rites activists of the past several years. I'm talking about steve Biko. If you don't know who that is, I urge you to head over to the off topic forum to read the post that I have put there. any other questions don't be afraid to ask.
