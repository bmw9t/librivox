Hi Dave,Here is Section 57.https://librivox.org/uploads/carolin/monastery_57_scott_128kb.mp311:00At about 7:32 there is a long Latin passage (beginning with Carta Regis). I skipped it, thinking no one would care about that. If you think I should include it, let me know and I'll stumble thru my less-than-adequate version of Latin. -- Bill
