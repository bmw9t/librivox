It has never come up, as far as I know.At this point in time, I don't think there's a policy against it. I suppose someone COULD read a 5-second excerpt, but I don't know of anyone who has ever tried (except for very short poems, but those are complete and not excerpts). I think it'd be a ridiculous thing to do, but we currently have no rule against it.If someone starts uploading 15 second short excerpts, the admins would probably discuss and create a new policy not allowing it. So while it is currently not against any rules, it would shortly become against the rules if someone were to repeatedly try it.(This is my personal view and my not reflect the opinions of others.)
