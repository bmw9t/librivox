Hello all!I'm considering helping with a recording project for Librivox. I've read a number of books in their entirety to my wife (including the Tale of Genji, which I don't intend to revisit!). We have also taken advantage of several Librivox recordings, particularly _Kidnapped_. We enjoyed the shift in readers from chapter to chapter.I am somewhat familiar with Audacity, as I've transcribed my vinyl record collection to 9000+ mp3 files.My outside background includes crewing on a square-rigger, so I am interested in adding more Maesfield to the catalog. I hope that my outside knowledge can make his writing more accessible for general listeners.mark
