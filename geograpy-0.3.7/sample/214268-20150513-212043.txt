This is not an audition, but a test of specs. http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/1-Minute_Test I didn't see your test posted, but if you've already done it, well and good.Please be sure to read the first post. All the information you need is there, but if anything doesn't make sense, please ask. You can also get lots of help from the wiki (link at the top of the page) or from some videos made by one of our admins https://sites.google.com/site/librivideo/for-volunteersI have entered you into the catalog using your forum name. Most of us add our real name, but that's not necessary. If you'd like your name added, or a personal webpage or blog, just let us know. You can access your page by right-clicking on your name in the magic window.Again, welcome and have fun!Lynne
