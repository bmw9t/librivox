jt -I don't know what happened here, but the volume on all the last one of these is way below our target of 89 db.  Would you please amplify and reupload these.  To check your volume, so that you know how much to amplify by: the easiest way is to install an extra plugin in Audacity that will tell you by how much the recording needs to be amplified to reach the desired volume of 89 dB.Replay Gain plugin for Audacity: - http://forum.audacityteam.org/download/file.php?id=4668    Save the file to your computer - your desktop or somewhere where you can easily find it.    Now browse to the folder in which Audacity is installed. It's probably in C:\Program Files\Audacity) and then open the Plug-Ins folder.    Drag the file you saved into the Plug-Ins folder. When next you start up Audacity, you will be able to select the whole recording (Ctrl+A on Windows), then go to Analyze | ReplayGain, and it'll tell you how much to amplify your file to get to about 89 dB.  If this is a problem, I can amplify these for you this time, but please make sure you have the input volume set correctly for your next project.  thanks
