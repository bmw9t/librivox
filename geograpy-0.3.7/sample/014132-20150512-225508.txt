Welcome to LibriVox arvwd  The place to start is the Newbie Guide to Recording, which tells you how to set up your computer to record. Of course, you may want to start out with Proof Listening. This will give you a better idea of how things get done here. Once you've done that, I strongly recommend doing a short test recording in the Listeners & Editors Wanted section of the forums. This is NOT an audition, but a way to check to make sure all your technical settings are correct, your volume loud enough, etc.Some neat video guides are available here: http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/User:PhilchenevertHave a look over at this project about microphone selection: viewtopic.php?f=19&t=31710Or you could do some Proof listening. I started with proof listening as I wasn't sure I would like to record. (but now I love recording). Proof listening lets you get a 'sneak peak' at the up and coming books.Have fun! Esther
