Here is Chapter 8, Section 8.  Time: 24:43http://upload.librivox.org/share/uploads/ck/steelhammer_08_ulbach.mp3I would like to take Chapter 9 as well.  I'm getting into the story although I must say I'm glad I'm not married to Jean, I believe he is sort of a 'pansy.'  How do you all learn to read so well?  I find when I listen to myself that I'm either lacking in emotion or I'm trying too hard and I come off sounding shrill.    Practice.....Deanna (Arteest)
