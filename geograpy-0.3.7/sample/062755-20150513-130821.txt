Hi Jason,Wedgewood Chapter 2 is well done. Not really anything to redo. The first 41 seconds tend to be a bit soft, but nothing we can't fix at this end. For future chapter readings, a good volume measuring stick is a range of 87-92 dBls. So about 89 is your best spot. There is a program you can download for free that helps you measure decibels. It's called MP3 Gain. You simply add your file in question and do a track gain. The program will tell you what level you are at. Then by doing small adjustments on Audacity (or whatever recording program you use), you can raise or lower your volume. If you have any trouble with this procedure, let me know. When I listen to your chapter readings, I will let you know how the volume level is doing.-- Bill
