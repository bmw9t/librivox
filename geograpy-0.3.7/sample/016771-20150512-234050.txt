I only speak American English.If you'd like to become a reader or volunteer, the best place to start is with this link:http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/Main_PageFrom there you can get information about recording listening and all kinds of neat stuff we do here, Browse around, find what interests you and perhaps make a test recording, Anyway, have fun here!Cheers,Betty
