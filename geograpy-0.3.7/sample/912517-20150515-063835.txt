Undoubtedly a given, but I don't get people who don't like reading. Not just the act of dragging your eyes across a page, but hearing poetry or watching a play or anything remotely to do with literature. I can think of few things more essentially human than a poem, and you "don't like poetry"? Is that even possible? I mean you don't have to join the cult, but come on. A quiet appreciation for the odd couplet wouldn't kill you.
