Filippo, I have listened to your testrecording. It doesn't sound bad at all, quite the contrary- it is good. Just keep it calm and don't be to much in a hurry (that is sometimes my problem, I think).
Perhaps You can do something - just a little - about your recording environment. It is almost perfect, but it is as if you are in a rather big room, and if it could be just a little, little  bit "closer" I think it would be even better.

We all LV-fans and readers, coming from so many different parts of the world, have different dialects, and that is what makes it quite fascinating actually. So get going.
