This is Clarinda, I just registered on your forums to be a reader. I found you through a google search for an audio version of "North & South". I love the idea of free audio versions of public domain books. I have voice and accent training, I have a BFA in Theatre. I was raised with a love of book and as a mother of 2 don't get a chance to sit and read; the audio versions let me enjoy my favorite stories even when busy.

thanks for the opportunity.
