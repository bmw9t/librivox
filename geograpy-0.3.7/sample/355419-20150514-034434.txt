I can follow the phonics of the text well enough, but I am really unsure about this accent.For instance, at one point the text says, "..ang kinabuhi alang kaniya"But it sounds like April is saying, ".. ang kinabuhi alang niya"    Maybe I can ask some of my friends if any of them are familiar with Cebuano, and they can help me out   If I were to listen to that without the text it wouldn't really matter, 'kaniya' and 'niya' are quite the same, because 'niya' is shorthand for 'kaniya' .  Thanks for trying Joe!  I don't know anyone who can do it but you
