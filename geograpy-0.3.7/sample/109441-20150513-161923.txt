Then I saw the name actually written in Italian in section 20, spelled Giunia, and I realized the J should actually be pronounced as a J in the English version. So I changed these. While I feel pretty confident about my Italian pronunciations, I am less confident about their anglicizations, so please correct me if I am inconsistent (or just wrong). Thank you. https://librivox.org/uploads/ruthieg/lifeofmozart1_21_jahn_128kb.mp3(20:47)Sorry about the confusion. And yeah, I'm still in for section 20. Please don't worry. Sorry I missed your original posting. It's always good to send me a reminder if I miss anything. Thanks for all your hard work. I too have difficulty with other pronunciations so don't worry. Thanks
