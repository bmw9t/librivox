That's a marvellous list, Nicholas, thank you!  

There has been some discussion of this fairly recently in this forum, so there are like-minded people around.

One hitch that I do see with many of the texts above is of whether they can easily be used for LibriVoxing.  All the ones which require passwords, for example, would need to be made available in another way.  If the terms of use prohibit that, we'd need to find another source of the books.

Also, some books might be claiming a new copyright, for example:

Dr. Esperanto’s International LanguageEnglish Edition, translated by R.H. GeogheganBalliol College, Oxford, 1889
A direct copy of this book would be fine by our copyright requirements.

New printing, edited and preface by Gene KeyesHalifax, Nova Scotia:  Verkista, 2000
Because Keyes has edited, as well as writing a preface, he can claim a new copyright on his version of the book.  We'd need direct confirmation that his version was in the public domain before being able to record it.

Or the Greek book I looked at says "Copyright © 2002 - 2007 Textkit.com All Rights Reserved. All Greek & Latin grammars and language learning books are developed by Textkit and they are intended for personal educational use only. The redistribution of Textkit files and content is prohibited."  That might not mean that they are claiming copyright on the older books they're sharing, but we'd need to be careful to check that they haven't edited along the way.

This is why Project Gutenberg's a good source of books -- although their selection may be smaller, it's always clear what the copyright situation is.


(I edited the links in your post above to make this thread display clearly ... I haven't checked they all still work, but they should be fine -- I didn't change the URL, just added nice display BBcode to them.)
