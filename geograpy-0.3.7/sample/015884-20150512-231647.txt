Hello everyone,I'm a girl from Spain who loves reading and languages, so I found this surfin the net and I though "well, that's a good idea!" and here I am. As soon as I get to know this project better I will try and volunteer for reading either in english or spanish (i'd love to try both).My real name is Sara but since it's a very common name I usually take Beatles songs for nicknames  (pretty used too, I'm aware of that...) Yo can refer to me as you wish.Glad to be here, S.
