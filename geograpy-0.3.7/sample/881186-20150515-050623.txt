Hi,

     My Father's Dragon was written by Ruth Stiles Gannett, however in a few places in the catalog entry (including the url : http://librivox.org/my-fathers-dragon-by-ruth-stiles-garnett/) her surname is sometimes spelt as Garnett.

    A second occurance of this is the Wikipedia link on the catalogue page :
"Wikipedia â€“ Ruth Stiles Garnett".

    All the best,

        Padraig
