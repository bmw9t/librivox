Captain Blood: His Odyssey
by Rafael Sabatini 

PIRATES --- and MORE PIRATES !!!

The fast-paced historical fiction of Rafael Sabatini is often compared with Robert Louis Stevenson and Alexandre Dumas.  

Captain Blood has lots of colorful dialogue and was the basis for the Academy Award-nominated swashbuckling film that rocketed Errol Flynn and Olivia de Haviland to stardom in Hollywood.  

Chapters are short, around 20 minutes of reading each, 30 minutes at most.

Here's a chance to extend your pirate adventures!  Get a reprint of the book (ISBN 0-7607-5596-5, for US$8 and Canadian$12).  Rent the 1935 film on DVD (for 13 100% positive reviews, visit http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/captain_blood/).  And compare the earlier movie with Pirates of the Caribbean. But best of all, you can voice some chapters for LibriVox!

Pirate literature continues to attract readers and listeners, especially young adults, both male and female.   Also, LibriVox would benefit from having more readers who are of pre-college age!
