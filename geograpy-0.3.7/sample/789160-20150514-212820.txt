Well I certainly can't fault your enthusiasm, Balfegor.  Just for the record, though there wasn't any problem here, if I get two versions of something we go with the version done by the person who requested it first.

*DONE*09-06 THE FARMER, HIS BOY, AND THE ROOKS <Balfegor> 
*DONE*09-07 THE ASS AND THE DOG <Balfegor> 
*DONE*09-08 THE ASS CARRYING THE IMAGE <Balfegor>

That's a nice set of pipes you've got there, Tae!  Hope to hear lots more from you here on LibriVox!  Don't worry about the mono/stereo thing.  When you read into a single mic (unless it's a stereo mic) the same thing is laid onto both tracks of the "stereo" recording anyhow.  The listener can't tell the difference between the two.
