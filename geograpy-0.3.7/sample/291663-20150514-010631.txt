Posting section 02 now. I'm not used to editing just few sentences after having recorded the whole thing, and I hope it doesn't break the flow of the reading. If you hear any problems, please let me know, and I will go back to my original file and just fix the one sentence where my misread word actually changed the meaning of the text, to minimize the interruptions in sound. Thanks!
