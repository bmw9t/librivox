Brendan: Thanks for the heads up. For a reason that I can't figure out the link has the https://docs.google.com/document/d/ left off the front of the link. I checked them all & I found one more. The links were all copied & pasted the same way.I leave early Friday morning. By afternoon I will be in Atlanta then an evening flight to Johannesburg. We return in mid-May.Katdad
