Chapter 03 -nice recording of an interesting chapter. Here are some notes:1) 5:26 you said "gabble" with a long "a" sound. I believe it should be "gabble" with a short "a" to rhyme with "rabble". "But it's a superstition. Dan'l waits on the front door, and sometimes goes on an errand; and sometimes you'll see one or both of them letting on to dust around in here—but that's because there's something they want to hear about and mix their gabble into."2) 7:03 "Well, then, big strike or little strike, or no strike at all, here's hoping he'll never lack for friends—and I don't reckon he ever will while there's people around who know enough to—" instead of "there"3) 7:28 your copy has "They knew he'd no business with an office, just as well as I did, but he's the hardest man to refuse anything to, a body ever saw." mine has "you ever saw"4) 10:29 "Washington started down town, now, to bring his trunk, for the hospitable Sellerses would listen to no excuses; their house must be his home during the session." instead of "house"5) 15:46 "The armies of Europe cost two billions a year now—I will replace them all for a billion. I will dig up the trained statesmen of all ages and all climes" instead of "all the ages"6) 17:41 "The Colonel glanced about him in despair. Then his face lighted; he ran to the wall and began to dust off a peculiarly atrocious chromo with his handkerchief." instead of "and he ran"7) 19:30 yours copy has "Why don't you get him arrested and claim the reward?" Mine has "Why didn't you"8) 19:46 "Oh, hang it, that's too bad.""Not so very bad, either." instead of "not so very, either"19:53 "Because he came down to Baltimore in the very train I was in, though I didn't know it in time." instead of "at the time"That's it for now.
