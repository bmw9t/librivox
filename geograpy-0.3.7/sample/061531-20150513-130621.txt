I would like to show a bit of a recording I did while listening (in the background you can hear it) the youtube recording of the 1956 series of around the world in 80 days. I am practicing to be able to speak with a french accent and would like feedback to see if what I am saying is acceptable or if it sounds terrible. Is there a way I can show that? with a link somewhere or something? or should I upload it to here like all other recordings? I understand the servers here aren't able to handle a lot of excess stuff, that's why I ask first  Looking forward to your feedback! p.s. I have done no post-edit so it's just the raw sound for the perusal of my attempted accent. I could even facebook message it to someone if that works Will,As I understand it, you want to upload an MP3 file with an example of you speaking with a French accent to get feedback from the BC on the accent.  If I have misunderstood, please post to tell me what I got wrong.Yes, you may upload a short file (let's say, 3 minutes max).  Upload it to my folder and post the link in this thread.  Once I see that you've gotten the feedback you've asked for, I'll delete the file.MaryAnn
