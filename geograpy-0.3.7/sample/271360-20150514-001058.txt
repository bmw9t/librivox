Jeff,Do you find this mic more sensitive than your other one?  Plosives are often caused by your breath hitting the mic.  The standard advice is to position the mic so that your breath goes past it, above or to the side.  You may also try moving back a bit.  I'm a full foot away from my mic when I read - maybe not the best in a sound engineer's ears, but it does help tame some of the mouth noise and keeps my Ps from popping.As to the pastes - I will take the sentence before where I am pasting in and play it several times, reading along as it plays, to try and get in the same "voice" as I had the first time I recorded it.  That helps me get close to the tempo, intonation and timbre of the original recording, but it is wickedly difficult to get a seamless paste - unless you read like a machine, which thankfully, none of us do.  It's one of those things where somewhat close is perfectly acceptable.MaryAnn
