Only two sections left to go, so I thought you might want to sign up as DPL for the next project: 

The Arabic Hidden Words by Bahá'u'lláh. This will be the first Bahá'í scripture to actually be recorded for Librivox and will be the first book by Bahá'u'lláh in the LibriVox catalogue, when finished. It's very short but very inspirational. Bahá'ís believe all of Bahá'u'lláh's writings are revelations from God but do attribute the authorship to Bahá'u'lláh as He is the intermediary between God and mankind and the Mouthpiece of God on earth. Thus there's no difference between saying it is God's work or Bahá'u'lláh's.
