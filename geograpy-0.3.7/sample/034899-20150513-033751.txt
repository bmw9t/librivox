Hey!  I'm Ryan, I am 23 years old originally from Nebraska, but currently living in California, I found this site recently and was kind of excited to contribute!  I am just starting my career in Archaeology, and studied plenty of literature in college and high school.  I've performed with choirs and in musicals and plays, and worked as an announcer/"DJ" for a radio station for three years.  So I feel like this is right up my alley!
