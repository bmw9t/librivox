Trish ... would you hate me irrevocably if I reposted section 12? I'll never do this to you again, promise, but once again, I found this section too fast. I am finding that these loftier historical pieces really need to be more slowly read, because the sentences are often so long, with multiple clauses, etc., that it's really hard to follow them if they're read too quickly.From now on, I will listen to recordings full through after I've edited them before I upload them, so I'm sure the pace is good.
