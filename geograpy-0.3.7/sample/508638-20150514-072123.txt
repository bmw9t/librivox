Thanks, ani. I am now able to access and edit your documents.

Quote:c'est que l'impression est relativement peu précise, alors le logiciel prend souvent un "l" pour un "7" ou un "v" pour un "u", par exemple. Mais oui. C'est bien sur le problème.  Particularly for me, as I don't have a French spell-checker, or any accented letters on my keyboard. Then (to be sure I have got the word right) I have to check on the scan - this would be unnecessary for a native French speaker, because they would know the word without any doubt. Quote:1- Premièrement, on a besoin d'un fichier .txt du livre. Project Gutenberg en fournit un.  Well, that's the odd thing. I couldn't find it on Gutenberg at all. The only text version I found was the really bad one on archive.org, that seems to read every 'h' as a 'b' and has no accents at all. 

I will gradually do the other sections, perhaps at the rate of one section every day or two, and perhaps you could run your eye over them to ensure that I have not made stupid mistakes like last time.   If I do not hurry, I should be more accurate.
