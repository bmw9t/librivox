Thanks Bear Creek Mama! I had already posted in the Listener's Wanted forum & have now changed it to "listener found." I assume from other posts there that this is what I should have done?!

Standard proofing will be fine... I listened myself so hopefully it's okay unless I messed something up removing the music.
