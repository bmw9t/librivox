TP,

Great! Just tell me what part you are interested in and you can give it a go. If you look at the first page of this thread (http://librivox.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=8971) you will see a window within the window (we call it the magic window). There will be a list with section, title, reader, notes and status as headings. If you look in the notes column, each part is broken out and you can choose any part that does not say either "CLAIMED" or "COMPLETED" by someone next to it. Once you have picked the part(s) you want, then hit post reply and let me know which part and section you want.

Enjoy,

Jason
