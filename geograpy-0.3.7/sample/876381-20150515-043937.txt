okay so after getting everybody two cent here's what I'm trying to put together.  I was talk with my local library district http://library.ppld.org/ and they like the idea of having a librivox group. The records would not be anything near pro. But far better that a $20 buck mic. And hopefully recorded in a room with amazing echoes (for all you rough corners people). anyway I just thought I'd let you guys all know.

Ps. tell me if you think its satanic or not to have a blurb for the library at the end just like "This recording was made possible with assistance from the pikes peak library district"
