I'm starting to see this as a rather special and important thing to be doing. I thought, oh, all of the good books have already been taken, made into audio books......but it is Not the case.....my understanding is that only 8000+ books have been made into audio's by Librivox..... and there are 47000+ on Gutenberg.org -- I recall that one year not long ago over a Million books/titles were printed in one year..... (in the world that figure is over 2 million now) Each year more books become part of the public domain....... Just to give an idea of how many are in the public domain - The U.S. Catalog, Books In Print for 1912 records over 160,000 books in print (160K titles, there were over 500,000 entries). Yes, not all of these stand the test of time.....but..... no doubt there are plenty of wonderful titles to appreciate and share with the world. I remember a book at USD library about travel in China c.1880 and some travelers were being carried around in sedan chairs! It was very interesting reading. aloha,joe t.(I'm tempted to suggest that Librivox is part of the process of selecting the world's worthwhile reading (and listening) material - those books chosen by volunteers here becoming part of something very special. )
