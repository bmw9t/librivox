While you are looking for it, we do like anyone co-ordinating a project , especially one as difficult as this may be , to have some experience in reading for a group project . The weekly poem is quite different in many ways . So if you could find something in a group project to read it would help you understand how things have to be set up and looked after  to run a successful project.
