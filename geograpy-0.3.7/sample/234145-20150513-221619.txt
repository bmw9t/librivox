I'm reading through the instructions and will keep an eye on the project thread for updates when sections/chapters are complete and ready for listening.  So far, I haven't found any but will follow along.  Any advice in addition to the FAQ and instructions for PLs and DPLs would be appreciated.  (I still haven't worked out how the MW works but I'm sure it will all become clear in time.)  Many thanks. LuceVdW
