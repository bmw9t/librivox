Hi Bill! 

Welcome to LibriVox! Section 38 is yours 

Before you start recording, please make a 1-minute test recording, so we can check you technical settings. More about the test: http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/1-Minute_Test And if you have questions, ask me here or in PM! 

Also, as this is your first recording, please let me know under what name would you like to appear in the catalog. It can be your real name, your forum name or a nickname. And we can put your personal URL on the catalog page too, if you have one.

Have fun here!
