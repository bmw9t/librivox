Hi Ssha,

Welcome to librivox!

You don't have to wait for us to assign you something to read -- you get to choose something on your own :)

We usually suggest that new readers start with something short -- you'll get fast feedback, and if there's something funny about your recording setup, or whatever, we can help you with it before you tackle a larger project.

Perhaps you'd like to read a poem for us?  Our Weekly Poetry project is lots of fun -- this week's poem *just* closed, but we should be posting a new one tomorrow or Monday, over in the "Short Works" section.

You'll also find out Short Poetry project over there -- you can read any short public domain poem you like.

Or, just look aruond through the Readers Wanted section and find something that looks like fun to you.  Check the first post for a list of available chapters -- anything that doesn't have a  reader's name next to it is (probably) up for grabs.  Make a post in that thread asking to claim the free chapter of your choice, then wait a bit for the book coordinator to reply and assign you that chapter (we try to check every day, barring emergencies), then read to your heart's content.

Give a yell if you have any more questions!

Kara
