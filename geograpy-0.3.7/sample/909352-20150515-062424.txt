robinel wrote:One of my favorite movie lines is from "Pride and Prejudice" (1940).  Near the end, Lady Catherine de Bourgh (Edna May Oliver) says to Lizzy Bennet (Greer Garson), "I am seriously displeased".This comes from the novel, Chapter 56 (fifth paragraph from the end): "I am most seriously displeased."  You have three LibriVox audio book versions to choose from:http://librivox.org/pride-and-prejudice-by-jane-austen/http://librivox.org/pride-and-prejudice ... -austen-2/http://librivox.org/pride-and-prejudice ... o-project/
