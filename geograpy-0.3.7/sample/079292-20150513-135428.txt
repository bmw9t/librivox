THE TIN WOODMAN OF OZ by  L. Frank Baum (1856 - 1919). Quote: A Faithful Story of the Astonishing Adventure Undertaken by the Tin Woodman, assisted by Woot the Wanderer, the Scarecrow of Oz, and Polychrome, the Rainbow's Daughter.   The Tin Woodman, whose real name is Nick Chopper, is unexpectedly reunited with the Munchkin Girl he had courted before he became a tin man. Sadly, she has a new love and no longer cares for him. As he attempts to regain her affection, Nick discovers a fellow tin man, Captain Fyter, as well as a Frankenstein monster-like creature, Chopfyt, made from their combined parts by the tinsmith, Ku-Klip.  Many exciting adventures happen to everyone involved and the Land of Oz contributes much magic and happiness to the outcome.
