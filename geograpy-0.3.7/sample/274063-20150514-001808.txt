I don't see any link that will let me listen to those chapters    I listened to the first two they were PL ok, it says 'complete' so I was not sure if I should mark them 'pl ok' or if they are just done. Sounds like a great book. I am landlocked here in Alberta but some of my favorite books are about the sea, sailing, ships and dessert islands, but I think I am rambling  I'm sure that Tricia has them in her folder and will put them in the MW shortly!  (I will PM her just in case, or just to bug her!   )  Go ahead and mark the chapters PL OK! in whatever color you like, doesn't have to be black.  I love having projects that are boy books.  I have 2 boys and they love to listen to books in the car before school.  So the better the book is, the more that mommy likes it!
