Hi all,

A while back I decided to make use of an old website I had to store LibriVox files, got a new URL and at the same time thought about making it into some kind of useful website. This has been quite a slow process in terms of being arsed.

Here it is:  http://www.carlmanchester.net , and I was wondering if any kind people would let me know if they think it is any use at all.

it consists of: 

1) A frontpage, where I've put some links that broadly reflect my interests. What do you think? Is there any point to doing this?

2) Links to philosophy texts: http://www.carlmanchester.net/links/index.html
is this useful, or just giving info that people could get elsewhere? Does it come across too much as if I'm setting myself up as a arbiter of what texts are important in a kind of a pompous way?

3) A list of audio philosophy titles: http://www.carlmanchester.net/audio.htm
Note: when I first joined LibriVox, this wouldn't really of stretched to much, so good work everyone...

4) A translation I did for the Essays in Radical Empiricism project: http://www.carlmanchester.net/James/james.html , which I hereby donate to the world.

Any comments are gratefully received...

Also, not to forget anything about layout etc...

Thanks,
Carl.
