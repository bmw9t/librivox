Mike, I just entered you as DPL, thanks!  Both of you have MW editing powers now.

Bill, if you'll enter a space between your file name and the period of the sentence, your links in the posts will work, as Mike noted.  I've changed the two on this page, sections 3 and 4.  (i.e. "filename.mp3 ." instead of "filename.mp3.")
