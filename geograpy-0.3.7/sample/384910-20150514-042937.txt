However, there's a fair amount of background noise in the recording.  Noise cleaning could help (here's the wiki page on how to do it: http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/Noise_Cleaning).  But, after I tried to noise clean it, the sound quality was not as clear as I would have hoped.  It would be best to attack this at the source, if at all possible.  Do you have any idea where the noise could be coming from?  Are you recording near a fan?  Or are you recording on a laptop?If you can't get rid of the source of the noise, then please go ahead and do some noise cleaning on the file to at least reduce it.  If you need any assistance, please let me know.Thanks.John
