I've recorded my one minute test. The link for it is here:https://librivox.org/uploads/tests/librivoxtestfinal6.wavI'm having trouble converting the file from .wav to MP3. I went to the page where you can download the lame_enc.dll file to convert to MP3, but I'm not sure which link to use. I have Windows 7 on a PC. Also, I am using Audacity and a USB headset microphone.Aside from the file format issue, is my recording listenable? I'm concerned it may be too quiet. How would I adjust it if it is?Thank you for your help and your time.
