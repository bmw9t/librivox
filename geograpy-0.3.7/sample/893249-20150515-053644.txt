Hefyd, diolch am ysgrifennu yn gymraeg – dw i'n hapus iawn nawr!  But I’ll go on in English in case others are reading this.  I must look up the poem you mention and have a listen.  It would b great to read some lengthy Wesh texts, but I worry that it would take me forever, as I don't have a lot of free time.  I shall seek out shorter works for now... but I do hope more Welsh speakers join as volunteers as time goes by - you're right, it is important for the language, and I shall definitely see if I can't  persuade one or two friends.
