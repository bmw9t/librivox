I was wondering if I could have Mr. Mason?   Or has someone already taken him?   Much obliged,Maddycaddy100  Hello!So nice to hear of your interest and I'd love to get another Eyre-head on board   Mr. Mason is still available but, as this would be your first recording, please complete the One-Minute Test that we recommend for new users before recording the role. See the Librivox Wiki for more info (http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/1-Minute_Test). After you complete the test and post it in the Listeners and Editors Wanted forum, get feedback and understand your recording setup, you will be good to go. Just reply in the forum once your test is done and I'll add you to the MW. Be sure to let me know under which name or pseudonym you'd like to appear in the LibriVox catalogue (your username or another name). We can also link to a personal website/blog.
