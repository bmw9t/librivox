While sitting here, sipping my morning coffee, I read through this thread and tried to remain objective.  I can see both sides of the "story".  As one poster said, "just because you can do something, it does not mean you should".  I guess the whole topic focuses on one's morality and what one believes is fair.

Perhaps Librivox needs to add or modify  the disclaimer at the beginning of all recordings.  Something like -

"All Librivox recordings are in the public domain and available for free download at Librivox dot org"

As a personal thought......I put many hours of effort into my recordings and often go out of my way to ensure certain pronunciations are as close to correct as I can make them.   Are my recordings professional?  Certainly not, or I would be doing this for a living and selling them myself.  Still, many of us do this with no thought to financial reimbursement to ourselves or to others.  In my opinion (and we all know what opinions are like), one should probably not "sell" Librivox recordings unless they are adding value.  Then they are certainly entitled to a fair return based on the value they add.

Just one man's opinion......that and a buck can get you a cup of coffee......some places.
