Hi Katty!

Welcome to LibriVox!  I assigned you for chapters 6 and 12. If you'd like to read more [now or later], let me know 

Before you start your chapter, please make a 1-minute test recording, so we can check your technical settings. You can post it in the Listeners Wanted forum, when ready and you'll get feedback 

And please let me know under what name would you like to appear in the catalogue. And we can put your personal URL on your catalogue page too.

Have fun here!
