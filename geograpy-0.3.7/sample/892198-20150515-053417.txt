You're a caching machine!   We haven't been out at all this week. It's been too hot and humid; it's just not enjoyable out there.There are a lot of caches that are hidden in a lot of undergrowth (grasses, etc.) that we'll probably put off until at least first frost, when the plants die back and the bugs go into hibernation. I've had more mosquito bites in the past month than... okay, than since the last time we went camping.
