Thanks Tricia, 1 minute test has been uploaded to the listeners wanted section.Yes the book is about 3 hours work, the challenge is that there are no chapters, so I am thinking to break it down into sections (3 would work as you suggested).This is my first time doing this, so still learning (quickly... hopefully)
