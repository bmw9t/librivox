Hi. I'm a new volenteer here. I fancy in calling my self a poet and a writer. Even though I'm too young to get anything published, this is how I spend most of my time. I really enjoy reading out loud and I took this opportunity when I found the site. I hope I'll be a good addition to the community. Thank you for your time.
