The LV catalog works fantastically well - it has a lot of information already. In the majority of cases, there is a direct link to the wikipedia page of the author which includes dates of birth & death. I would vote that in such cases, we don't need to add those dates extra to the catalog page.

In the lists on the wiki, all cases where there is no such direct link, or where there is translator info missing, were put in italics - it's not too much - I think adding that information to the catalog summaries would be a chore that is still manageable (although I don't know how much work it is to change those summaries) - I still think it would be a nice service for the non-American audience.

What do you think?
