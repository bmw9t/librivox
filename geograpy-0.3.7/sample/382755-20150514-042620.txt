Hi,This is the first time I've been presented with this problem and didn't quite know what to do to rectify the situation.  So I went to the effect tab in Audacity and amplified the entire track.  I hope that this was the correct thing to do and that it's better now; or did you want me to re-record section 8?  I don't have a problem with that.  How do you determine what level the db is?Here is the corrected section 08 --------I think for now.http://upload.librivox.org/share/uploads/tg/johndeneoftoronto_08_jenkins.mp3Time  20:35
