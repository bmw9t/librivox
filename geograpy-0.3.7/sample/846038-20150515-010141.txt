Praise for TriciaG via the 'Thank a reader' feature:Quote:Hi Tricia G, I just want to thank you so much for the Ester Reid Series.  I'm on the 4th book now, and you have read every one of them so far!!  I'm assuming you will be reading all of them.  Wow! I'm enjoying the books so much, and you are just a wonderful person to do so much.  Thank you! Betty B.All "Pansy" recordingsAll Tricia's recordingsRuth
