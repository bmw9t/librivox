Per Tricia's suggestion, I thought I'd post a sentence in a book I'm reading solo, Peggy Raymond's Way:"And then her relentless common-sense, awake at last, went on to assure her that the Horace Hitchcock who had made love to her in the park the previous evening was in all essentials the smug, vain little boy nobody liked."And I managed NOT to laugh.But I had another line I'd been meaning to post in the hopes it hadn't been done so already. I finally read, per a suggestion here  , Patricia Brent, Spinster and had to relisten to this line and look it up to make sure I'd heard it correctly:"Oh, Patricia! why will you persist in being a cold douche?..."Wow! Bowen was ahead of his time!
