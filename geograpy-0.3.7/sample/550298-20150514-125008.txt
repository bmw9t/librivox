Chapter 6, 7 and 8 are wonderful 
Just some minor detail, after you finished the recording you need to leave a short silence, 5 seconds when the recording is shorter than 30 minutes and 10 seconds when it's longer than 30 minutes.
So all that needs to be done is amplifying a bit and inserting the silence at the end, then it's perfect!

Edit: I wrote 15 minutes, when it should have been 30 
now the information is right
