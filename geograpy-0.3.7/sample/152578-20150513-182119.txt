I PL'd your section, and changed the status on the Magic Window but I don't know how, I forgot to post in the forum itself.   Section 6:At 2:01, you said forget instead of forgot in the sentence (in the poem) "Forgot my mourning wishes, hastily" . Since it's a poem, I thought it should be precise. Thank you for the follow-up (and the catch).  I will try to fix tonight and re-upload so we can hopefully close out this section.Take care,Greg
