Quote:I think the idea is that whether they are part of LV or not, people SHOULDN'T listen or download from the Listen links unless they're PLing or editing or doing some other project-related task. However, since there's no way to prevent it and still make the links accessible to people who need them, all we can do is explain the policy and the reason behind it and hope people abide by it.Exactly.
