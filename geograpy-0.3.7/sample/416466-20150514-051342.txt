Tricia,I have PM'd the reader for Section 9, but have not heard from him.  I will go in and do some snipping to fix his section.  I will also go over the rest of the sections to adjust volumes and correct any missing tags.  Probably not tonight, but hopefully Wednesday.  If Mike doesn't beat me to fixing his "encoding" issue, I'll fix that as well.MaryAnn
