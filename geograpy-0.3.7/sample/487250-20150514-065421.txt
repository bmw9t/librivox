Hi Ava.A Happy New Year!!I finally finished recording and editing of section 11 and uploaded the file.I tried my best to valance two different voices, but am not sure if it sounds OK.Would you please let me know your feedback when you have time?Thank you so much for your patience.I wanted to finish earlier, but my son's exam was more time consuming than we had expected.Anyway, if there is anything we should change, we are happy to do so.Best regardsDill
