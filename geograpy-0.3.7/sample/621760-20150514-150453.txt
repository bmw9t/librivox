Giacomo - Ooooh Congratulation, I hope youre looking forward to the next years cause I promise he's gonna make them fun. quite fine that you need to orphan the section, I do hope to see you back around LV at some point, but real life, especially children are more important by far!!

Violet - Terrible sorry about your lack of voice, I do hope you'll get over it soon. Perhaps when you do you'll rejoin us?

Annise - Thank you many times over. RE: Checking on other sections I'll be doing a round of those this weekend, so fear not.
