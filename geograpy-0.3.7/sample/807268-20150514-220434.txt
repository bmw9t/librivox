Listen to Librivox Community Podcast Show #93
Duration: 17:48Hosted by Cori!

This week’s show is on the theme of Getting Started! 

Karen Commins gives some excellent advice as a relative newcomer to LibriVox.

Earthcalling provides a musical interlude. Go Librivoxateers!

Hokuspokus, icyjumbo, Andy Minter, redaer and Great Plains discuss how they pick projects to work on, their routines before recording, and also give some hints for first-time LibriVoxers.

The promo at the end, I *think* is from Brad Bush (please correct me if that’s wrong.)

Contributions to next week’s show, on the audio you’ve most enjoyed listening to this year, are very welcome … please send MP3s to the ‘cs’ folder on the uploader, or email / PM me.


PLEASE NOTE: Because the podcast folder has grown to a humungous size, and was becoming really hard to edit & add to each week, I've split 2006 and 2007 out into separate folders.  You'll find them at: http://www.archive.org/details/librivox_community_2006 and http://www.archive.org/details/librivox_community_2007.  I don't use iTunes, and it's probably a bit late now anyway, but if anyone wants to tell me how badly this breaks links, they'd be welcome.  FWIW, I won't be archiving 2008 until mebbe Sept/Oct 09.
