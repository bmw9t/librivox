I just downloaded WavePad to try it out.  It seemed to work okay, but I was really surprised to see a "re-take" option while recording.  This is just the sort of thing we were talking about in the "Audacity feature wish-list" thread.  

The gist of it was that we were looking for some way to record over mistakes instead of having to edit them afterwards.  The feature in WavePad is not quite as robust, but it seems like it could be made to work.  Kristin or Ezwa, do either of you use Re-takes?  And have you gotten used to it so that it's not awkward and overly time-consuming?  Just wondering - if so, I may give WavePad a closer look.
