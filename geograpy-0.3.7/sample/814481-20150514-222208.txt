Is there a place (dictionary?) where all the acronyms used in the LibriVox forums are defined? I know PL = Proof Listener, but what does IP mean? I understand BC means Book Coordinator, but what does MW and DPL mean? I recall reading about what some of them mean in the newbie guide to recording and the newbie guide to proof listening, but it seems there are so many more! However, is there a "dictionary" post somewhere in the forum for them all in one place? If not, I'd be happy to make one once I know what most mean! Thanks, in advance, for any help you can offer!  _Kelley
