Okay, Dawn. You're all set. I haven't read this one since I was a kid. Should be fun! 


A couple of questions:

It looks like the book has 19 chapters. I assume the first section will be the prologue, and then one chapter per section thereafter?

Where did the summary come from? Did you write it, from Wikipedia, the text, etc...

Do you have a proof-listener you usually work with or have someone particular in mind? If not, at what point to you want to advertise for one? Keep in mind that since Mr. Silverberg is still alive (bless him), this isn't going to be PD for many outside the US, so your proof-listener(s) may need to bear that in mind depending on where they live.
