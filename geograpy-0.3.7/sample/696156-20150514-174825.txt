hey lucy,

i have uploaded the last missing chapter, so it's in your hands now.  i'll get the summary completed in the next day or two so this one can get into the catalog. i know of one listener who is waiting patiently for it to be complete.  looks like the western section is really beginning to build.   i'd go for another one since i have at least two dozen of them downloaded by various authors, but i think i need a change of pace. i'll get back to them though, never fear. i love westerns and i have never read these old authors before.

again my sincere appreciation to you and jo for all your help and patience in getting me through another project.

ta ta 4 now
rowdy
