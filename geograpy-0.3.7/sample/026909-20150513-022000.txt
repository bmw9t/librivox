Hello all, I'm Eric from the Phoenix area. 

I was browsing LinkedIn.com searching for groups on how to get into the audiobook industry. I'm a huge fan of audiobooks of all types and spend as much time as I can listening usually during my long commutes, working in the yard or while at the gym. I'm also familiar with torrents and seeding. 

So now I just have to learn the How-To and get started volunteering my time! 

Thanks,
Eric
