I don't know who is in the right or in the wrong but, in the LOC, in most instances, "Voltaire" is found "by itself". 
"Voltaire, François Marie Arouet de," is found too but with no texts directly linked to it and no hyphen in the name. 

Gallica2 lists him as "Voltaire" but two instances of the name (as in our catalogue at present) can be found here and there.  

As far as author names are concerned, we're going by what the LOC does, aren't we? So, I'd go for "Voltaire, François Marie Arouet de," (no hyphen). 
Those looking for "Voltaire" would have no trouble finding him and the rest of his name would still there. 

What do you think? 

EDIT: a few googlebooks have him listed, full name, as in the LOC.
