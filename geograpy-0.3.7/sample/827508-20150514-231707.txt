I'm glad it's effective; I had a quick look, and the bottom two sliders that Audacity offers have had their descriptions trashed, on my display.  But I've not played with it.  I don't have too much trouble with s's; my main difficulty is in pronouncing particular pairs of adjacent words.

I just had a quick look at my most recent story:

the troubling of spirit that had crept over him ...  which I read, if I'm not careful, as "that'd"

the question he had begun with    .... "he y'd"

Gayton was at a loss how to answer him  ... "w'z'ter"

Tongue tripping, and the residue of my London accent causing trouble in pronouncing h's, I see.
