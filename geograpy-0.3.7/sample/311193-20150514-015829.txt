I'll MC this for you. We'll still need a basic PL to make sure the intros, outros, ID tags, and tech specs are all OK, but I'm guessing this should go pretty quickly if you have them all recorded already. If you would upload the first to my folder (tg) I'll check the tech specs on at least that one for you. I can't get this set up right now; it'll be later this evening.
