Just because I felt like doing a short one: Chapter 31. I think this might be where the background hiss starts - it is much more noticeable in this chapter than the others I just PLed.@00:53 there is a loud click between sentences.@01:30 a stumble over the word "prejudiced"@02:40 a stumble over "dried grass" which is then repeated correctly.@03:06 a stumble over "she detested"@04:07 the quoted sentence is supposed to be "D'you know, fine thing for catarrh, peppermints" but it is written in dialect. I think knowing what it is supposed to be will help with fluency and pronunciation. Try that one again?@04:33 stumble over "probably"
