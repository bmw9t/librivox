Hi, 

 I was going through the "You know you're addicted to LV when..." thread (yes, all 22 pages of it), and Starlite suggested that I could do a podcast about it. Perhaps ask a few people to record about their addiction, put them all together? I have some ideas on how to go about this, and I'm open to suggestions, and I'm really looking for help in editing, and if this is allowed, I'd like to time this podcast for June 23rd. 
What do you think?
