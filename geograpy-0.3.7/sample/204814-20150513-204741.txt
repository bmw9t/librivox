PL NOtes for section 16:   Chapter 13 part 1.Yes, you need to add "end of chapter 13, part 1" at the end and then add the 5 seconds of silence, export with the same file name and then upload again.  Please put a note in this thread that you have fixed it and uploaded so I will know to check it. I enjoyed listening to you read this story, Paintonthemoon,  your voice is very nice.  However to make y our future recordings better (and I hope you make lots), please move the microphone to the side of your mouth.  You have a lot of 'plosives, where you breath hits the microphone directly and causes an annoying little explosion.  You don;t need to fix these but listen to 0:2; 0:35; 1:34; 2:29, 2:31; 4:49 and 5:24 for a few instances of where this happens.  Moving the mic to the side reduces this because the air moves past instead of directly into the microphone.  Also you seem to move close to the microphone and then back away while you speak which causes variations in the volume.  I suggest moving an inch or two further away and keeping it at that distance since  you become muffled when very close and are clearest when farther back.  Everything else, the volume and tech specs are right on
