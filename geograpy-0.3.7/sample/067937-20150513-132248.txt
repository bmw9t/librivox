I've had a PM with the BC to clarify my earlier post.  Sorry for the confusion.Correct  -- I did NOT intend to claim anything at the moment.  I'm sure someone will be along to take the narrator part.  I've got quite enough to keep me busy at the moment.Looking forward to listening to the completed work!
