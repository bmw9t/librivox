You can let me know if there is another section you would like instead.  Meanwhile, before you start, please submit a 1-minute test in the Listeners Wanted forum to check that your technical settings are all OK for LibriVox recordings.   Also as this will be your first recording for Librivox, please have a look at the NewbieGuideToRecording and also read carefully through all the notes in the first post of this thread if you haven't already done so. More info about the 1-minute test is herehttp://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/1-Minute_Test I'll also need to know by what name you would like to be listed in the catalog. If you have a personal website, that can be linked as well. Thanks and welcome to Librivox.
