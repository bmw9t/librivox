Hi Drew thank you so much for taking the time to answer my post, I will have a go at making a one minute recording as you suggested, can you tell me where the text for the recording can be found and I will go and practise, I'm not convinced yet that I will like the sound of my own voice but will hold judgement till its done, there are so many excellent narrators on here that I have high standards to live up too as you know.Thanks again.
