If you have any questions I will be glad to help. 1) please insert the name of story and author after your name in the beginning (the first post says to do this). 2) Your volume is too high at 95 dB.  I suggest that you run the Compressor effect if you are using Audacity.  This reduces the loud spikes without touching those of normal volume.  If you're not sure about this I will be glad to make a little video showing you how to do this.  Just say the word! 3) 3:21 stumble "motions"    6:08  pop should be removed    7:44 noise     8:13 stumble "as it's..."    9:07 stumble "the-his.."    13:24 stumble 'striking ..
