There have been a couple of comments on the Blog post I did for our latest "Picks for your listening pleasure". Only problem is... they are both in Russian, and although I think they are complimentary, Babelfish does have its limitations. 

If any Russian speaker would be kind enough to respond to them, I should be most grateful.
