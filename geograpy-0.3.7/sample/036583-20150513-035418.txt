Hullo Sam, lovely to have you joining us!

Helpful criticism ... well, I've got treacle on the connection today, and am still downloading.  But (and this is ALL just I.M.O.) I would suggest that perhaps you stick to slightly older stuff until you move to New York, as T.S. Eliot's work isn't public domain here in the UK, and won't be until 2035.  In practice, the files are stored in the US, and so as long as we abide by US law, it's probably okay ... but in theory if someone (I can't think who, but ) wanted to get ugly-legal about it, I think you might be in an awkward position.

File's on 70% ... I'll pop over to your thread in Listeners & Editors Wanted when I've got it all.  In the meantime, though, have a look round, jump into any thing that looks fun, and enjoy yourself!
