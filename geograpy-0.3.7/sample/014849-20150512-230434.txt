It's still a bit quiet. You need to move closer to the mic. It sounds as though you are talking through a tunnel.  You also have significant background noise. (I suspect it is the built in mic causing this)You have variations in the volume. (this limits how much a file can be amplified) To fix the inconsistent volume, try the leveler under 'effects'. Select the whole recording, "effects", "leveler", Select "moderate" (or use a heavier setting if needed).  This brings the high bits down and the low bits up and makes for more consistent volume. Just remember to level the recording when you are done editing. You may need to do this for all your recordings. (Just look at the wav forms, if there are high and low bits, this will fix it.)Try another please. You can post it in this same thread to keep the forum tidy. Please name the file 'test_nanawrote" no spaces and no caps.Esther
