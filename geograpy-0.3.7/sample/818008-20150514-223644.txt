Well now, inside each file the e0001, 2 etc. are there, but the following letters and numbers are random.Another little spanner in the works- I had tried to sneak the recording open in media player.  Obviously it wasn't going to work, but when you're desperate you'll - I mean I'll - try anything.  However all these littled and e files are windows media & 'open in audacity' isn't given as an option!  It occured to me that option 2 would get the recording open, and then instead of having to re-record the whole thing it would just mean re-recording that section.  Yes?Thank you for your help and your patience, Ruth.Carol
