I've recorded my test clip but can't seem to export it as an mp3. A popup says that Audacity needs the file lame_enc.dll to create mp3's. I've downloaded that file but still can't seem to get it to work. As you can tell I've very new at this all! Do you know what I'm missing? Thanks so much, can't wait to get this uploaded and get started!Annamariep.s. I'd like to go by my name Annamarie NakimuliHi Anna Marie.  I am just back and think we can solve your problem; a common one for everyone.  This may not be current, but hiere is a video about the topic  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rraizMiOf8s&feature=youtu.be .   You basically have to download LAME then put it into the right folder inside Audacity.  I think the latest editions do this automatically.   Keep trying and this will soon be solved and you will be recording!!That makes it so much less confusing! I can't tell you how much time it's taken me but I think I've finally managed to figure it out. Here you go and thanks so much again!http://uploads.librivox.org/tests/test_Skylark07_%282%29.mp3Annamarie
