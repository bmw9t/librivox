I will assign Section 04 to you, but I would highly recommend that you complete your 1-Minute Test before you begin this section.  Please be assured that it is not an audition of any kind, but will merely allow an Admin to make sure that all of your technical specs meet LibriVox requirements and that there are not other problems to correct (like volume, background noise, etc.)  It's better to clear up any audio problems before you begin recording sections.  You will find some helpful info about the test here: 1-Minute Test.  Post your completed test in the "Listeners & Editors Wanted" thread per the instructions.  An Admin will be by shortly to give you some feedback.I need to know the name that you would like to use for attribution in our catalog--?  It can be your real name, your LibriVox User Name, or any variation that you wish.  Also, we can link to a personal website or blog if you have one.  Just let me know.Please don't hesitate to ask for help if you run into problems or if you have questions.  There are many friendly people around here who will be happy to assist you!
