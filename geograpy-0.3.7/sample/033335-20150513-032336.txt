Hey,   sorry I've been busy.   Found my microphone and its crap, and can't find the book I want to do, and I just payed for Leopard for my Mac, so the cash is a bit short, so I'm going to have to wait on starting till the next social security check shows.  :/     But start I will.........

 I think its best use a headset mike anyway

 But I'm still here and I just finished listening to The Lectures of Robert Ingersoll.   Wonderful stuff, not had any to read in ages. Thanks!
