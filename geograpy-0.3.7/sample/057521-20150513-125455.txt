Starting, which mic should I get?  I'm a newby, but I'll work to make my section good.  Thanks so much for putting it together!   Hi Emory and welcome to this project.  To start, you will need to upload a little one minute test so that we can be sure that the technical aspects of your recording setup are all OK before you actually start recording.  Instructions can be found in our Wiki and in the first post of this project but here is a video that may help too: How to Make your 1 minute test.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlaRY_-bcfs and then How to Upload your 1 minute test How to Upload your 1 minute test(You may post the link to your test in this forum and I will see it much more quickly)I also recommend Getting To Know our Forums Getting To Know Our ForumsAnd how would you like to be credited in our catalog? What name? most of us use our real name but it is up to you.I recommend a USB microphone that plugs directly into your computer/laptop.  It doesn't have to be expensive at all.  Most of us use Audacity to record and edit our tracks.  The link in my sig has some videos designed to explain how to do this.  Ask lots of questions. The hard part is setting up your equipment; after that it is more fun.
