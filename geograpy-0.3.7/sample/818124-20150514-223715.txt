If it is happening often - it is probably due to Audacity running out of space or processing power. It runs with gigantic temporary files - it allows you to undo every step so a big editing session needs big big files. It also uses much processing power - make sure nothing is running in the background.Automatic saving can be risky - there are times when I have found it skipping bits of sound because it is running out - and if you don't notice you overwrite your last complete file.Anne
