I see a difference, so I'll just speak up.
The listeners get to champion their favorite listens, speak up for them, even analyze them a bit and convey that assessment -- it makes for a little extra thoughtfulness about what is appealing about a reading or readings in general or readings to one particular person. It's almost as revealing about the listener as about the selected, championed piece.

It's a great little new feature.

I have an idea.
How about if folks who really do have some idea of what would make a Great Libritzer Award kind of methodology, think their idea out a bit into a post. Suppose there are 7 people who love the idea and actually have a few pieces of a clear picture in their mind. Let's hear their 7 clear pictures of whatever piece they see.

Rather than starting off with committee design and simultaneous approval or disapproval going on -- not a very um, healthy environment usually for actually generating ideas -- let's start with some plumped up individual visions. Keep it all in the Yes-And stage of thinking for a while. Then whittle down to some actual suggestions for folks to show thumbs up or down.

I adore brainstorming.
