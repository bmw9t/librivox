PL Notes for section 21The reading is great just a couple of edits. There should be 5 seconds of silence at the end of the file as it is less than 30 minutes long. We don't normally ask you to reupload for ID3 Tags but as you need to edit the silence please could you edit these. The tags should be as in the first postTitle: 21 - Typical Dreams - Dreams of the Death of Persons Artist: Sigmund Freud Album: The Interpretation of Dreamswe need the number in the title to help with cataloguing later all other specs of the file are correct If you could complete these edits and re-upload the file using the same filename that would be great thanks
