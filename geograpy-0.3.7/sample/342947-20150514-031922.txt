Good evening, Graham--I listened to your last sections--I have a few notes for you--Section 09:--At ~00:39 the text shows "and its mendicants were then as now few"--but I hear "and its medicants were then as now few".--At ~19:29 the text shows "no way to escape from its unwelcome favours"--but I hear "no way to escape from its unwelcome flavors".--Needs 10 seconds of silence on the end.--Volume is a bit high at 91.1 dB if you want to de-amp -1.5 Section 10:--At ~16:37 there is an omitted phrase "and possibly also to his bodily comfort".--At ~17:53 the text shows "and that point is the reason why"--but I hear "and that fear is the reason why" --At ~24:00 there is a small repeat "Maghrabins, or--or Arabs".--Needs 10 seconds of silence on the end.--Volume is high at 91.8 dB if you could de-amp -3.0And, Graham, wow--I would not have believed that there could be that much difference in tone with the two microphones!  I preferred the second mic (that is, the mic that you used for the last portion of the recording).  It had a more pleasant, kind of "round" sound (clearly I don't know the correct words to describe it) than the first mic.  Anyway, just my amateur opinion after listening with my amateur ear.  I am curious, though, what brand of mic you switched to?  Very interesting to hear the difference.You and Gaby are keeping me busy!!
