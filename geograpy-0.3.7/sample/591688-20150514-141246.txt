Speaking of short works, I just posted a new one Legend Land. Each legend is about a page long and are fun.  Its a great way to test your recordig setup. Just head on over and claim a section and start recording. Just read over the first post carefully as it gives all the intructions on file naming and what to say before and after the legend.

Have fun!
