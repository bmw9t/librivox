And then before I got it recorded again without all that, the flooding started here in Middle TN, and my job had changed my hours... (My home wasn't part of the flooded area [thankfully] but plenty of friends' and co-workers' homes were.)Anyway, blah blah blah... but I'm going to have to retract my offer to read that chapter. I just don't have time right now to try to figure out why my recordings started coming out with all that background noise and how to fix it.My apologies. I'd hoped to really get into this LibriVox volunteering deal, but it'll have to wait for a while I'm afraid.Please remove my name from the Chapter 16 assignment, so that someone else can volunteer for this one.Thank you, and my apologies for holding up the process for this book over the last week or so.


No need to apologize. You're very kind.
I'm sorry to hear that the flood is effecting you. Thanks for letting me know. It is very considerate of you.
Reassigning the section is not a problem at all.  And when you do get a chance to get back into it, the background noise and stuff like that is easy to fix. Sorry for not giving any help with that.  Please come back when you are ready.  Thanks for your first recording. I hope it will be one of many. Hope you will read something in a project of mine when you come back.


Best wishes to you all down there.
