Section 16

@ 4:28 
It was under the impression of these
massacres that the Deputies of the new or
third Assembly of the Revolution, known to
history as The Convention, met in Paris.
This Parliament was to be at first the actual, later the nominal governing power in France during the three critical years that followed; years which were the military salvation of the Revolution, and which therefore permitted the establishment of the democratic experiment in modern Europe.
The highlighted section of the sentence has been omitted

Section 17  All okay

To be sure I have had a very great listen this morning!  Thank you!   Mim
