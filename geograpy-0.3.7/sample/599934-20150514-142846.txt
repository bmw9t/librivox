Oh, my pleasure!  I love piratey stuff, and was mildly bummed that all the chapters for this book were already assigned, so proof-listening was my next best way to be involved.   

I definitely heard no annoying hum or electronic noise.  The recording was very clear and pleasant!

I know, I've recorded a few things now, and it's always best to have someone else PL your work; you've heard it enough by the time you have a final recording.      I enjoyed this one a lot.
