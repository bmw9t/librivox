I've downloaded your last two, but I thought I would let you know it may be Monday before I'll have some quiet time to sit down and listen against the text.  If I do manage to listen this weekend I'll probably have to use the Google text as I haven't been able to access PG since yesterday evening. It seems several on the forums are having the same trouble.
