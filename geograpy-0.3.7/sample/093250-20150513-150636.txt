Welcome! Sorry about the delay in anyone responding to this.   On the technical side, your volume is too loud. You should aim for your wave forms to peak near the 0.5 mark, like this:Since you're not recording with Audacity, I'm not sure how you'd lower the input volume. If you were recording in Audacity, I'd say move from 100% input volume to about 70%, and see how that goes.Other than that, I think it's fine! But please upload another test with the lower volume setting, so we can check it.
