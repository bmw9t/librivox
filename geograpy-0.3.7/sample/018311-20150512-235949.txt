Nice to meet you, Kelly! Welcome to Librivox! And thank you for joining us.I see that you might want to start recording an audiobook of your own so if you please visit this link here http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/Newbie_Guide_to_Recording Set up your software and mic. Then your next step is to send us a short test recording. More info here http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/1-Minute_Test This is NOT an audition, however it is a sample for anyone to see if your technicals are correct and ready to go CHRIS
