I'm getting a little confused with this thread - not quite sure who's doing what any more... I've created a new table in the wiki http://librivox.org/wiki/moin.cgi/ulysses15c
It's just above the character list, called "Tasks to do" - I've made a start putting things in from what I could get from the thread, but there may be more - can people sign themselves up, can Anita put up the tasks that need doing, please?

I'm looking through now to see...
