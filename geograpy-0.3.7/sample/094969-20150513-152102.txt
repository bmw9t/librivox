Bill,Welcome to Librivox!  That's an excellent recording.  Technical specs are good, volume is right on target at 89.5 dB, no noticeable background noise.I'll mark the thread OK.  Head on over to readers wanted and find something that interests you.Only one thing to watch going forward - notice in your test file how when you said a couple of the "p's" the wave form spiked up?  Mine does that too when I'm not paying attention.  If you click on View | Show clipping in audacity, it will put a red line on your file wherever the sound waves are clipped off.  Clipping may cause distortion in your voice and is therefore to be avoided.  You just want to be aware of this and that is probably enough to keep you from the big spikes or bursts of sound which would lead to clipping.  Enjoy and I look forward to hearing you around!MaryAnn
