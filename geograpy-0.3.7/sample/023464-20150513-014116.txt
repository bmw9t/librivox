Welcome prettyprey,

Sounds like you have done some interesting things.  And if you are looking to record some French, you have come to the right place.  Seems like we end up with a bit of it here and there are plenty of people like me who run from the sight of it.  

You can go here to read up on a lot of information about what we do here and how: http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/Main_Page
