Quote:Forgiveness by George William Russell, read for LibriVox.org by [your name]. [Add, if you wish, date, your location, and/or your personal url.] Then read the poem: Quote: At dusk the window panes grew grey;The wet world vanished in the gloom;The dim and silver end of dayScarce glimmered through the little room.And all my sins were told; I saidSuch things to her who knew not sin—The sharp ache throbbing in my head,The fever running high within.I touched with pain her purity;Sin's darker sense I could not bring:My soul was black as night to me:To her I was a wounded thing.I needed love no words could say;She drew me softly nigh her chair,My head upon her knees to lay,With cool hands that caressed my hair.[17] She sat with hands as if to bless,And looked with grave, ethereal eyes;Ensouled by ancient quietness,A gentle priestess of the Wise. At the end of your reading, leave a space and then say: Quote:End of poem. This recording is in the public domain. Please leave 5 seconds of silence at the end of your recording.
