Welcome to LibriVox!   Every time we begin an activity we feel anxious to perform our best.  It's totally natural, I think.  I can only imagine how frustrating it might be for a child who is just learning to stand and walk not to be able to run or jump...  The victory belongs not to the one who can do everything perfectly the first time, though.  It is in persevering in the effort to become better, and in accepting that only the conscious application of will, combined with acceptance of inevitability of mistakes and desire to correct them, do we grow and vanquish our weaknesses.I won't tell you not to worry, it's pointless, you're going to worry regardless of what others tell you.  Just remember that every great mind in history started as a student who knew practically nothing, every great athlete was at some point but a crawling infant.  You have made your first steps on your journey.  May it be a long and satisfying one!
