Hi Katie,I've been slowly working on a few of LibriVox's basic how-to pages, and I wonder if you would mind checking these ones out -- we're not even 1/3rd the way to a complete set of getting-started guides, but a couple pages may still be helpful to you.We've wanted for a long time to consolidate and update and complete our how-to guides, but it's So Time-Consuming and ... uh ... I'll stop my excuses there.Here are two pages that could be helpful.

Hi Anita,

Thank you so much for your post. I may have read some of this last night, as I think I saw your name in there somewhere, but my eyes were drooping, so...I will definitely check it out today.

At this point, I am most uncertain about editing. I tried a practice piece last night and couldn't seem to accurately pinpoint my errors in the "wave". Was thinking, could I possibly read these 11 pages in one breath? errorless? Probably not!

I hope I don't drive you nuts with my questions, but I'm optimistic that eventually I'll get the whole picture, if you can bear with me while I learn.

Thanks again,
