Maria: I think your disclaimer looks good. That way people know ahead of time that, if they are easily offended, they can choose whether or not to listen to that particular story. I have come across many things in the PD that I would like to record but there are things I find objectionable. There are just some things I don't feel comfortable saying.
On the other hand, other people may have "thicker skin" than I do and don't mind saying certain words or expressions. So I think a little disclaimer to the listeners is a good way to handle it. Lets them decide if they want to listen or not.  If we omitted or chose not to record every work that is today seen as offensive, it wouldn't leave us much to read. LOL. (Just look at how women are portrayed in most works of "classic" literature. ) 
Usually these things are "innocently" said under the beliefs of the time, but there are some so-called "classics" that are so blatantly racist, sexist, etc, that I would not care to read or listen to them. Historical context or not.  I think ultimately, leaving it up to each reader (and listener) is about all we can do. 

Breefolk, thank you for pointing that out about the foolish dictionary. I haven't read the whole book myself, but I did come across something in my own section that I wasn't sure about...I didn't know if it was just some old expression that I wasn't getting, or if it was meant to be a "joke" at a particular group's expense. I did look at your section after I read your post. If I have a chance I'll try to read some of the other sections to see if there are more things like that. I might end up putting a bit in when I write my summary, to the effect that "some modern readers may find some of his definitions objectionable."
