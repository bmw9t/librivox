Just wondering, if people are willing to share. I didn't want to use the word "unemployed" because I think there are others here like myself who are not full-time employed but also not looking for work, for a variety of reasons.I started here on LV when I was at home after having my first baby. I've never gone back to full time work since, due to the chronic illness I developed after the birth of my third child. At the moment I work one day per week, which is about as much as I can manage.I love LV because I can do it at home, when I'm not feeling well, from my bed if necessary! I can control my workload (unlike my actual work) and choose to record or just to listen.I've noticed we have quite a few university/college/school students and homeschool students, and some retirees. Who else is here?
