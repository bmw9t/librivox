Welcome to LibriVox, Will!  It's becoming a regular family affair around this place  

We'd love to have you as a contributor, but never underestimate the value of the listeners too!  Without listeners the whole thing would be an exercise of futility.  We're glad to have folks listening as well as folks reading!

Be sure to check out the Weekly Poetry thread.  This week's poem takes less than a minute to read and is a great way to get into the swing of things.
