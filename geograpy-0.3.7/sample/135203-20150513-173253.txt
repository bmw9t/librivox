Thanks, Adele!Just a couple of small notes for this section--there is a rather long silence between words at 5:24-26 that could be cut down.  Also, at 6:06 and 6:26, there are a couple of loud noises that come between words and can probably be edited out without too much effort.Getting closer and closer to finishing!   bookAngel7
