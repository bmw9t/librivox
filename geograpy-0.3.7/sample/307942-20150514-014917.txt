Thanks for the invitation!Hi, Dawn--I listened to your section, and you did indeed do a wonderful job.  You have a lovely voice--it was a pleasure to listen to your reading.    I just have a couple of notes for you--First, we have a couple of small tech problems.  You named the file "seriouscall_05_law"--but you actually read Section 07.  So the file name should be "seriouscall_07_law" instead.  When you upload the corrected file for the notes below, please name it using "07" for the Section ##, and all will be good on your end.  On the ID3 tags, the Track Title field is not correct.  It should show exactly what is in the MW for Section 07--so it should be "07 - Chapter 05 - Persons that are free..." for the Track Title when you upload the corrected file.  (I have been advised in the past that the easiest way is to "copy and paste" the Title from the MW--just a thought.)David, there was already a file out there for Section 05 that had been PL OK'ed (recorded by fbtoast).  So can you go behind the scenes and make sure that the correct Section 05 file is available for cataloging?  If Robert or I need to take some action on this, please let us know.Section 07:--At ~3:20 the Biblical citation is Matt. 25:21--but the verse number is omitted in the reading.  Perhaps you could add on "Verse 21" so that the citation is accurate.--At ~4:37 the text shows "Be sorry for its impurities, its spots and imperfections"--but I hear "Be sorry for its impunities, its sports, and imperfections".--At ~5:05 the text says "humble it with penance"--but I hear "humble it with patience".That is it!    Great job, Dawn--I hope that I'll get to listen to more chapters from you!  Have a good weekend!
