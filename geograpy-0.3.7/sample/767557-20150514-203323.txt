Yikes, Annie!

With all the positive feedback you are getting, I feel that I must soon, as a fellow Mississippian, begin recording Life on the Mississippi!  Right now I am into the world of Robinson Crusoe ...

You must be on a positive high ... and you deserve it for your excellent and accurate reading of the Mississippi dialects.  (I know Jim's is a special challenge, but you are rising to it)!
