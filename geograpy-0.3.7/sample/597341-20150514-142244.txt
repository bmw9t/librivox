Hello squash! 

Interesting fact about your hearing range. Mine is actually a bit more limited than usual.  

This is just the right way to make a claim. Since this is your first recording, however, it would perhaps be advisable to first record a test recording of a paragraph (edit, check below ) or so, upload it to the server, and post the link either on this thread or listeners wanted -thread.

If you title it something like CC-my test you'll get feedback for non-technical aspects as well (CC stands for creative criticism).

The details of uploading can be found in the first post of this book - choose xx for MC for a test recording. I have assigned ch 6 for you, and you can check your own Librivox page here.
