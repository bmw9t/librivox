Dear Jo,

I've decided I'd really like to help you finish with your/our group's project so sign me up for 18 and 19.  (Especially since one is rather short.) There will be plenty of fiction around (or redos or things finally coming into the public domain eventually) Besides, I have to read the book to do any fictional part justice and that takes time.   

One question.  Should I have just said M as it appeared on the page?  I should have realized and suspected at the time, it was, of course, short for Monsieur.   My logic was that if they wanted the entire word it would be translated that way if. (perhaps they expected more savvy readers - or I was in denial)  It would be an easy edit I could simply record "Monsieur" (with a proper accent) and insert it over the "M" which would be cut out and I could recheck for errors.    

Finally, if a name is in my MS dictionary then it is easy to pronounce but many names are a bit too obscure. I can find reference to some names but no pronunciation guide using Google.   

I suppose one just settles upon a reasonable pronunciation of a  name. We all know that phonics rules go out the window when it comes to names.  Since much of my sections are in France I go with my very limited knowledge of "Francais" for what sounds most reasonable with a French accent.  

Sorry to be a bother with so many questions but better to learn now than edit later.  Thanks again for all your kindness and patience.
