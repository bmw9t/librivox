I am wearing a headset.  I hope I wasn't playing with the cord - I'll have to be aware of that and make sure not to.  And I'll try not to move my head a whole lot, but I doubt I'll be able to keep it perfectly still - too much to think about all at once while trying to read properly lol.  All comes with experience I'm sure.  Thanks for the tips and instructions.
