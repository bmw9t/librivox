On straightforward projects like this , the tags are not a real problem with the new system - we are still debating whether to ask for them - it does come in handy sometimes for the oddly labelled files that turn up in one's folder at times but probably not worth re uploading filesIt's nice and easy to add new sections now isn't it - and it's actually possible to add them in the middle if a section becomes too long - you just add it at the bottom and move it up to the right place and they all renumber   Anne
