Hello everyone,A friend of mine, a big fan of audio books, who also listens to the audio-books produced by this community told me I should  visit your website.I grew up trilingual: speaking Tajik (Persian, mother-tongue), Uzbek (Turkic) and Russian. Later on I studied English Philology, did my Master's in Germany and by doing so learnt German. And at the moment I am working at perfecting my French.Ever since I learned to read, I read out loud. I needed to hear myself to understand what I was reading. And since I was schooled in Russian I had to work on my pronunciation too. I always read English, German and Russian texts out loud. This could be a contributing factor to the good diction, I was told I have on numerous occasions. I love reading books out loud. And I look forward to working with you. I have never produced any book. I have however, played in staging of Shakespeare's Hamlet (an adaptation) in English. After a few nights in a theatre we recorded our play in a radio station into an audio-play.I hope to listen and to read books with you.Best, Nafisas-voice
