Praise for Z@p (Peter Zinn) via the 'Thank a reader' feature:  Quote:Hi, dear people, i so much enjoy his agra-schat reading while i am working on a soapstone with the window open looking in the friendly evening sky. He took so much effort to make the reading interesting - plus i do love the dutch language - it is a great pleasure to listen and i feel very thankful that he did all the work. Thank you, Peter Zinn!!! And by the way: Utrecht is een heel mooie prachtige stad... de domtoren vindt ik super mooi!!! Friendly greetings from GermanyGyandaDe Agra-SchatAll of Peter's recordings
