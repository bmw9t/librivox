I have wondered whether if you go to re upload a file,  the uploader renames the old one then if the upload doesn't work you are left with the renamed file only ?  That would explain renamed files and no ordinary one

I have only been checking some files a second time mainly because of download restrictions and I was told in one of my early PLs not to bother checking but I haven't been totally happy about it - even experts could reload the same file.
