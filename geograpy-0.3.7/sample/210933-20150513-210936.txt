Chapter 27 posted, but when I clicked the status box for this chapter (and for ch.26) nothing happened - no drop down menu.I'll make the correction to chap 21. I will also, I am afraid, rerecord some  passages in chap 20. This is because I discovered only when I reached chap 27 that the character of Miss Geraghty should have an Irish accent (Trollope makes this explicit).Finally, I have detected another error in the Gutenberg text in Chap 27. At c. 14:40, the text is "I want to know what it to you're a-going to do" but it should be (as in another edition) "I want to know what it is youâ€™re a-going to do"Anthony
