Useful link for those who would like to check out Samson microphones:http://www.samsontech.com/products/brandpage.cfm?brandID=2There are short audio samples for the USB microphones, which listeners may find interesting.  The Q2U USB/XLR Microphone comes in a pack with cables and a set of headphones and is surprisingly cheap.   I thought the sound on the USB setting was pretty good, the only obvious flaw being the noticeable sibilance.  Samson states that the frequency range extends to 15000 kHz which compares favourably with Samson's cheaper dynamic microphones and is much higher than any headset microphone.   It is available on Amazon for $US60.CheersAlgyPS. Samson is not paying me for this promotion, but perhaps they should be.....
