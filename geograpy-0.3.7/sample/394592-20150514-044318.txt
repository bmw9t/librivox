Hello Girlies,I thought I had finished editing 38 but I hadn't. I will post it ASAP. I am performing this week but I can use it to unwind, ha ha ha! Ruth, thanks for saying that about my editing. I do sometimes wonder why I bother. Did you hear any of the earlier chapters? It was only after I had finished treating everything that I realised I had recorded at least three hours worth of speech, covered with bird's song! All the best,Sandra.
