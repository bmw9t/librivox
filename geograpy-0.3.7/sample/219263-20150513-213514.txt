I'm sorry, Repunzelina, but may I impose upon you again?Later in that same section is another passage with additional Greek words.  Looking at the scan of the text, it doesn't appear they are the same words as the section you translated/transcribed.  Would you be able to sort out these as well?They appear on page 268 of the original volume, in the two paragraphs starting with "Justice, after passing through the state of negative communism..."Thank you in advance!~Chriscavedog wrote:Excellent!

I suppose we can get that paragraph from the archive scanned pages (it is the same book): http://archive.org/stream/whatispropertya00prougoog#page/n314/mode/1upQuote:The Latin words for robber are fur and latro; the former taken from the Greek φορ, or φήρω, Latin fero, I carry away; the latter from λάθρω, I play the part of a brigand, which is derived from λήθω, Latin lateo, I conceal myself. The Greeks have also κλέπτης, from κλέπτω, I filch, whose radical consonants are the same as those of καλύπτω, I cover, I conceal. Thus, in these languages, the idea of a robber is that of a man who conceals, carries away, or diverts, in any manner whatever, a thing which does not belong to him.The greek words can be pronounced as:φορ = forφήρω = FEE-rohλάθρω = LA-throhλήθω = LEE-thohκλέπτης = KLE-ptisκλέπτω = KLE-ptohκαλύπτω = ka-LEE-ptoh
