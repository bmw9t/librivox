Hi there,

I've re-uploaded Chapters 5 and 6 - I went back back to my original project from Audacity and normalized, noise removed and amplified in Audacity 1.3 Beta.  That's what I normally do - not sure how I forgot to amplify that first time around   !  Hopefully the volume will be better; if not, then I'll probably need some suggestions on how to do it!

Can't wait to hear the finished book!
