Hello,  I'm new here.  I desperately want to read some chapters but there would be dogs barking (both Shadow and Zephyr) and kids demanding attention on every track.  As it stands, I listen a LOT during my long commutes.

And I apologize for starting off with criticism since I do love this place but I've noticed that the versions of War and Peace, Book 5, chapters 4, 5, and 6 available for proof listening seem to be from book 1.
