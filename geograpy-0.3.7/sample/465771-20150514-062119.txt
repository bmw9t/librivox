I'm sorry Scott,I do have some problems with your file.1. It's so loud that there are quite a few clippings in it. I deamplified your file by 4 dB and I used my Clip Restoration utility.2. There is an irritating sound on the background. I used my Noise Reduction utility the filter that out. For reference: I only filtered 50% of the background noise.I reuploaded the file. Please check it. I hope you'll approve.Bart
