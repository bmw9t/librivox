No, it was catalogued this afternoon at 1:25 pm.  Looks like somebody was faster, that happens. It annoys me too at times... There is no way for you to tell which projects have been pre-claimed. Not all the pre-claims go through here, I often claim my BC projects or those for which I am MC (the BC usually asks in the respective thread) directly.
