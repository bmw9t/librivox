Ryan: I listened to your John Clare reading and jolly good it was too.
The technical quality may have been good too but I wouldn't know because a. I listen on a pair of tinny speakers on my PC or, when I'm on a country walk, on my iPod with some cheapo earbuds and b. I have cloth ears*. So far as I am concerned, the criteria are : Is it something I want to listen to in the first place? Is it clear and can I hear it? Does the reader make it sound as if it might be interesting? If those are 'Yes' then I'll cope with the rest, I'll noise clean it, I'll slow it down or speed it up and I'll positively enjoy the Serbo-Croat accent (or even the English one). Sound quality is like wine. Who on earth wants to develop a palate for fine wine? It just means you can't enjoy perfectly good ordinary table wine.

* I know I have cloth ears  because Anna (who I love and am grateful to beyond measure) picked me up on a strange noise in one of my recordings. After I had amplified it tenfold I could hear it. It was either my fingering the script prior to turning over or rain falling in the next county!

(I say this with apologies to those who have heard one of my recordings and think to themselves 'Why doesn't the silly **$%*  keep his fingers to himself & get a decent microphone')
