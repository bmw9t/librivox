I'm new here, but I believe I'm up to the task.Looking at it, I'd say the logical way to break it up appears to be12) Prooemium, epistle dedicatory and preface of Instauratio Magna (5200 words approx)13) Plan of the Instauratio Magna (4850 words approx)14) Preface of the Novum Organum (1750 words approx)That makes section 14 significantly smaller than sections 12 or 13, but I think that would be better than putting a break in an arbitrary location. I could do the shortest part first, to get feedback ASAP. Is that OK?That sounds logical ... I'm leaving it up to the reader where to break.  By the way, it appears that the auto-notify got turned off in this forum.  Hopefully, this post will re-activate that feature for me.-denny
