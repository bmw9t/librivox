You can view the catalog page here:http://librivox.org/the-foolish-diction ... eon-wurdz/This a a short but amusing dictionary which "redefines" words in some interesting ways. Funny and sometimes bizarre observations are sprinkled throughout. Sections are mostly quite short (some sections consist of multiple letters, in the case where the entries for those letters were short.)Note - if anyone can come up with a more detailed description, feel free to contact me  How to claim a part, and 'how it all works' hereTo find a section to record, simply look at point 5. below at the sections.
