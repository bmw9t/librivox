Hi there, My name is Anthony, I'm 34 years old. I am British but have been residing in the lovely country of Denmark for the last three years. I enjoy reading aloud to my girlfriend in bed at night, or rather, she insists I read to her! I first came across Librivox about 3 months ago when I was on the internet searching for a copy of The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius to listen to whilst I was at work. After enjoying the audiobook experience and then hearing about the possibility of volunteering to read for Librivox I thought it might be fun to give it a whirl, so here I am. I've found that now I live abroad and am spending my waking hours struggling (still) to master a foreign language, well it feels indulgent and extra relaxing to switch the brain cogs off once in a while and slip back into a book written in my native tongue.  Merry Christmas all!Anthony
