youre all set! i added hugh as dpl already before you gave your ok, i hope thats alright. i noticed your file name is awfully long, you can shorten that if you want.one thing i am wondering about: what is the reason for the proof listener reading along with another text than you? from yuor note, i assume it is that the proof listener is checking the scans instead of the text you read from to make sure there are no errors in transcription -- is that correct?
