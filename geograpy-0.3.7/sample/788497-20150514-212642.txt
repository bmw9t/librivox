Hi Annie,

I'm using a Logitech microphone with a USB connector, and Audacity on a Windows XP system.  I've turned the volume up to maximum in every place I could think of; is there a setting on Audacity that I'm missing?  I thought I set the volume to maximum there, too, but is there another setting there that I should know about?

Thanks!

Larisa
