And of course, thank the LibriVox org!I am writing from Brazil, where I am a student of English language and its literatures at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, and the audio books of LibriVox has been helping me keep up the weekly reading assigments of the course. Otherwise it would be very dificult for me to read myself aroung 200 pages a week.Thank you guys! Your work is wonderful!
