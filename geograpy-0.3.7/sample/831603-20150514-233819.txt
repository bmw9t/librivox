No, it was the actual podcasts I was after, Cori.  I'd been talking to someone at work about the podcast which had the out-takes from our first London Chapter meeting (Number 24?).

I hadn't thought of "Save link as" .. because I'm a bit literal minded and thought that it meant simply copying a URL to the clipboard.  It does work for downloading the whole file.  It might be worth mentioning that on the wiki .. I can't get access since I lost my wiki password.

Thank you both,

Peter
