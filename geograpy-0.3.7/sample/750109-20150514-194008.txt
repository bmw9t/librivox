You may want to post a small section of the chapter so you can get some feedback and tweak any possible technical problems before you read a whole chapter.

Also, don't forget to check out the Newbie Guide, and when you post your selection please let me know what name you would like in the catalog and if there is a url you would like connected with your name.
