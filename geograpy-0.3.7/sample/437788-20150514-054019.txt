Here I am, with quite atrocious background noise this time that doesn't want to clean properly...   If you have any ideas, please let me know until tonight, so I can try and fix it. Also, I only read the definitions - turned out there were six   "The definitions of Book VI of The Elements by Euclid"http://upload.librivox.org/share/uploads/rg/6thanniversary_elementsvi_ava.mp33:31http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21076Thanks, that was fun!
