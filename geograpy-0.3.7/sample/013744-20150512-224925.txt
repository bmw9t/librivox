The LibriVox folks suggested that as a first post I should share a bit about myself to ya'll.  That would be you, of course, who is reading this post.  As I was pondering what to share, I thought of several outlandish things I could make up to "impress" you but. ya know ----the truth is that I'm just a guy interested in a new adventure.  So, here I am.  After 38 years in the telecommunications business I decided it was time to retire and "play".  I also spent a number of years in the retail florist industry and at one time owned 7 shops.  Too many!!  Anyhow the retirement action was submitted to and approved by my wife.I've recently started "another" career, professional voice over acting and I suspect many of you are also involved in VO.  Anyhow, while taking my VO training one of the suggestions was to become involved with LibriVox as a way to practice, develop my VO skills, and contribute to a worthy cause.  Since completing several VO workshops etc. I've have several discussions with my VO coaches as well as others about LibriVox and decided to give it a go.So, there you have it.  I'm open to any guidance anyone would like to share.jimbo
