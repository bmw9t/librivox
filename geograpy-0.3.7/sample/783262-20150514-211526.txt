Though I'm familiar with his magnum opus, Crane's War Is Kind was unknown to me.  A collection of poetry from 1899, it speaks to the darkness into which men descend because of war.  I found it intriguing.  It is, in its own way, even more "out there" than the product of the Beat Poets.

I also found it here:
