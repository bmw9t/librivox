[quote="PaulW"]Chapter 17 - Belief and Unbelief:  OK to catalog!

I did notice some background noise, however...not very distracting, but noticeably there. Here's a possible fix that you might want to try if you're using Audacity 1.3.3 or later ............


Thanks for that Paul   

I WILL try to clean it up and will repost.  I think the noise is my computer fan - duh!!
I have done chapter 18 with the microphone inside a lined box (yes, really), so it should be much reduced, if there at all.
Will repost in the next day or so
