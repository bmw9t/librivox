My pledge for MARCH MADNESS (by the way, I actually do like basketball, until softball/baseball season starts, but enough about me):

I pledge to finish the last FIVE chapters of Rafael Sabatini's _The Sea Hawk_.  Sandra and I alternated chapters of this truly wonderfully written romantic pirate novel. Anyone who knows Sabatini (ask Gord) will attest to his acumen as an author.

Sandra and I then began a collaboration where she edited in my narration with her characterizations, building on both of our main talents, but it got stalled ... ah, life.  So we got side-tracked.

But our original conception of alternating chapters is just about finished, so I will do the FIVE final chapters before too long after the Ides of March.
