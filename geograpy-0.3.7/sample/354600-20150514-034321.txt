- If you have already completed your recordings and posted them, please do so again as they may have been misplaced (our apologies to you if this has happened.)

- If you don't think you'll be able to complete a recording, please let us know so that we can reassign it.

- If we don't hear from you by June 1, 2007, we will reassign the sections. However, don't feel bad about this or take it personally... real life happens, and we understand. There will be plenty of books left to record, and you're welcome to come back when you have more time.

As always, if you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask us =)
