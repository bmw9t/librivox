Did you do the math and notice that the poet was 42 years old at that time? Elizabeth Boyle, who was much younger, became his second wife. He had married Machabyas Chylde in 1579 and had a son and daughter by her, but little is known about her, not even the date of her death. After Spenser's death (after less than 5 years of marriage), Elizabeth married two more times, bearing a son during the second marriage. She died in 1622.Len
