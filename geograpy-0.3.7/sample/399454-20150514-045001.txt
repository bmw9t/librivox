Hey Veronica,If you are looking for a DPL, may I volunteer?  I am one of those "Chicagolanders", but I grew up in Kewanee and drove by the Utica exit today as I headed to my parents for the weekend.  I've been there hiking a couple of times (while still a local) and I'd love to learn a bit more about it.MaryAnn
