As for why people are not listening to the recordings on YouTube...I'm no expert, but my guess is that people don't think of audiobooks when they go to YouTube.  They think of something visual.  Also, to watch/listen to something on YouTube you have to have connection to the Internet.  That's fine for quick videos or songs.  But, I would think most people who want to listen to books prefer to do so when they're away from their computer and/or Internet...jogging, driving, in the park, etc.  So, I would think a more portable medium is preferred.That's my two cents...
