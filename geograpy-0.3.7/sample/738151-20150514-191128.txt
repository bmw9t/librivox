Complete!  All audio files can be found on our catalog page:http://librivox.org/the-enchanted-castle-by-e-nesbit/

This will be my first solo project (not counting poems and short stories).  It's my very favorite Nesbit book.  There are points when it transcends the "children having magical adventures" genre and becomes truly magical.

The e-text is at http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext02/nchtl10.txt, though I'll likely be reading from a printed copy rather than the online version.  There are 12 chapters, and I'll post them here as I complete them.

I don't want to feel rushed, so I'm going to give myself lots of time: target completion date is July 31, 2007.  That way I'll also feel free to pick up other projects at the same time.

Peter
