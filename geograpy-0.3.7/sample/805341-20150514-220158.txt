Hello all,

I've added my first file direct to the Catalogue Page – thankfully I've done Wiki coding before or I'd have been completely lost, lol – but I wanted to make sure I'd done it right before adding any more. Maybe if someone that knows what they're doing could double-check this one before I do anymore? It's "Myths and Legends of Ancient Greece and Rome" by E.M. Berens.

I have 4 more uploaded ready to go but not till I know I've not mucked it up!
