I'll sign you up for the narrator - thank you!I would say, based on what I've seen done in other plays, read all the stage directions, except the ones that say how someone is speaking. For example, if it says "Rosalys, [In despair.]" don't read that, but if it says "Rosalys, [Running out onto the terrace.]" you read that. You also don't have to read all the character names. Just the first time they speak. Other than that, all the stage directions, each separated by a few seconds of silence, please. It's better to have too much and not have to use some of it than to find a missing line when I'm editing Thank you!
