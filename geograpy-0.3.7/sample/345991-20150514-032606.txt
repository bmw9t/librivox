Thanks, Bart.The question is not when he died or whether it was okay for Librivox (copyright issues, etc.)The question was: what should I put for publication date--this is something we normally post when we upload a recording?The second question was: the book from which this story came has several translators.  So I do not know which to use during the recording.Thanks very much for the prompt reply.Chiquito
