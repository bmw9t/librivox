I would like to volunteer, reading English and Spanish works. I am a medical translator and interpreter and a bilingual storyteller.  I have acting experience since age five.   I would really love to read princess furball which is an ancient tale but recently re-published by a British woman in the 1990's; how does the public domain fit into this scenario? Look forward to reading my first chapter!
