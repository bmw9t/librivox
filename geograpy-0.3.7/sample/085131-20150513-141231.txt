OK, I think you're set up. A couple notes:1. I changed the intros a bit to get rid of the "by various, translated by various" stuff. What I picture is in the first file, give a bit more information in the intro, then in the subsequent ones, not quite as much. Then the final outro on the last file, give the full info again. You can record the authors (err, Bible versions) in whichever order you want in the intro/outro; I just slapped them in there.2. ID tags aren't required for this. The new cataloging system will automatically enter them from the titles in the Magic Window and the other data in the database entry.3. The file names have changed slightly since the old system. We now add a "_128kb" to it. See the sample file name in the first post as a guide. Also, since there are more than 100 sections, you'll need to use a 3 digit section number in the file name.4. I've filled in the first couple section titles for you. I'm not sure what the plan is for section 0.  You can fill in the rest either all at once, or as you go along.5. As per my last PM, you've got "Matthew Coverdale" in your summary, but I think it's supposed to be Myles.Ummm, I think that's about it. Let me know if you have any questions.
