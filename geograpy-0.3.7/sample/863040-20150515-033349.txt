I've also done as TriciaG suggests...

It is even more enjoyable when I listen and read the text together.  There are a few accents I find difficult to understand, but I am sure there are some who will roll eyes and groan when my chapters come up (I'm a new reader, just learning the ropes).  I love the way Librivox supports all readers... if we can't be the best, we'll try to be the best we can.
