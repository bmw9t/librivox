Why Hello Lamide, and welcome to Librivox.  Congratulation on your MS in physics!  Great to have another scientist on board.  I know that is no small accomplishment.

Dare I suggest you look at these physics related book suggestions which I made just last night:

I am going to also suggest that you place you recording sample in this thread:

so that more Librivox volunteers can hear it and repond to it.
