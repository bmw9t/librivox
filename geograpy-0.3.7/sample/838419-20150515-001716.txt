Jc,

There were three versions of the erp file which I downloaded before Cori renamed anything.  Both the one with the correct filename 

primeofyouth_tichborne_erp.mp3 and the one you have listed above http://upload.librivox.org/share/upload ... 075656.mp3

are the corrected file.  An earlier upload  http://upload.librivox.org/share/upload ... 1207075223  is the original file with the click still present.  

So it seems like everything is working as it should and the problem is on your end somehow.  Perhaps a cache issue as Robert has suggested.
