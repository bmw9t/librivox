My 2 cents:1.) I believe volunteering in general is important in the US and also the UK. In Austria, not so much. I don't know about other countries, but if volunteering is not ingrained in your culture, less people will go looking for volunteering opportunities.2.) (Again speaking with my Austiran-goggles on) Audiobooks are imo just now starting to become mainstream. They used to be for kids and old people, only. [That also goes for reading out loud in general.]I don't think there is really anything we can do to attract more readers (short of actively advertising) and I believe the community in general is really welcoming and open towards new volunteers. The only thing, I can think of is having beginner's projects. Short & easy. At the moment, we usually have different short works collections where people have to find their own works first. If there was a project with short sections (~500 words) reserved for beginners (maybe with a limit of 3 sections per person), that might make it easer for some to start off and not get frustrated by sections of 3000 words or more. I think there have been English projects like this - unfortunately they are probably hell to administrate and prooflisten...
