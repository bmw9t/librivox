Praise for Nullifidian via the 'Thank a reader' feature:
Quote:Hi NullifidianThanks a lot for your reading of The Cloak. It's one of my favourite Gogol short stories, and your recording was a great way to revisit it.If can you remember, could you tell me what is the music piece you used in the recording?Thanks a lotPedro
The Cloak is to be found in Best Russian Short Stories at http://librivox.org/best-russian-short-stories/


N.B. This recording has no music, so I think the correspondent must somehow have become confused.
