Dear Rainer,
you are wonderful(':D')
It was really simple, I have learned something new again. It is Jokai Mør and a few books are there, none familiar with the English title.
Thanks, thanks and thanks. Finished watching the old Sovjet version it is pitifully butchered. Without reading the book it makes not much sense.
greetings, Éva
