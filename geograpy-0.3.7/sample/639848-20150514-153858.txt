LOL, Timothy, you could record it too, we'd have dueling dragons.   Your voice would be perfect for it!  My son is starting a "dragon phase" (he is deep in the throes of a dinosaur obsession, and dragons seem to be a natural offshoot of that); so that's what prompted me to do this one.  There was another E. Nesbit dragon story in one of his library books; I can't remember but I think it was called "The Last Dragon."  The dragon turned into an airplane at the end.  That one is just a wonderful story but she wrote it a little bit too late for Librivox, more's the pity.

Section 1 is ready!
