Two small notes:Volume is 94.5 in MP3Gain and there is some clipping; volume needs to come down.At 18:47, “…surest thing you know, Miss Betts…” (very minor editing glitch, end of word is a bit clipped off--may not need to be fixed, but give it a listen and see what you think)Thanks! That was fun. Thanks Caprisha and Sherri!  Sherri, you are a great PL-er!  Thank you so much!
