Once you get enough of a taste of recording, you'll learn to be OK with the mic I'm sure  I don't know of anyone (without previous recording experience) who wasn't a bit hesitant at first. It's hard to get over hearing your own voice, and sometimes it's hard to convince yourself that people will actually want to listen to it
