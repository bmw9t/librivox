Hi Sue,Section 07 has these sections for you to listen to:2:07.5 to 2:10.0  "more did the sect increased" should be "more did the sect increase"3:18.5 to 3:22.0  "had entered the bint masters dwelling..." should be "mint masters"3:49.0 onward "and she was executed S. Lawrence..." should be "...executed asked Lawrence"Everything else was great.  Thank you.Carol
