However, I don't find you in the catalog, so if this is your first recording, per the First Post, I'll need to know what name you want to appear in the catalog.  But even before that, have you submitted your 1-minute test to make sure your recording software is set to LV's required parameters?  Please check this page out:http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/1-Minute_Test I look forward to hearing back from you when your test file has been approved.
