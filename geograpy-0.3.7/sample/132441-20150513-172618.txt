How, then, do we get around that drop down box that shows up in the MW when we Add New Reader.  It asks for both username and real name, and if you don't fill both in, you get this message, in red: Username and Display name are required.  Maybe Display name could be same as username?I know I prefer my real name to show up in the catalog, others might not wish their real name to show up anywhere, but at least we should give new readers the knowledge of what their choice at this gate means.  Question.  Can it be changed later?P.S. Sigh . . . . . still so much I don't know, Mr. Phil.  It makes me want to cry.
