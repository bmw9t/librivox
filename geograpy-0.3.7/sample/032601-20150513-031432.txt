I've just recently found this site, and I'm enthralled with it. Its a wonderful effort and I'm so pleased to have access to these wonderful works in audio form, for free. 

I am a book and video publisher by trade, concentrating on the subjects of audio recording production techniques and music industry areas. I am an audio engineer and musician, and have had the pleasure of publishing some great books on the recording process. The LibriVox project combines my love of books and recording, and I'm impressed with how many people have taken to the task of recording a book. Its a lot of work. My hats off to you all and my thanks.

If I can provide any advice on recording techniques, hardware (microphones, pre-amps, etc), software for recording, editing, mastering, noise-reduction, etc, feel free to ask. I work primarily with the Mac, but the recording techniques are the same no matter what software you use.

Keep up the great work and thanks again for such a brilliant use of the Internet!
