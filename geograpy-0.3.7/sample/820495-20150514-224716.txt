unless your iPhone is jailbroken, you probably didn't actually download it - Apple doesn't let you download files from mobile Safari. What probably happened is that you were streaming it from the internet inside your browser. Hence, the files are not stored on your iPhone.To actually download them you'll need an app, such as this one: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/downloads-downloader-download/id343307433?mt=8. This one costs $1.99 - there is a free version available, but it is limited to only 7 downloaded files at a time. And since you're trying to get a whole book, that probably won't really work unless you just get 7 files at a time. Hope that helps!
