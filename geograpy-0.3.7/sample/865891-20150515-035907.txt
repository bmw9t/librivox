This has been a point of opinion in the editing process I've always found interesting. Several how-to's I've read, both at Librivox and elsewhere, recommend "clucking," using a clicker, thumping the mic, or otherwise "spiking" to indicate where you've made an error to mark it for later editing.

To my mind, this method could, at best, be a back-up reminder during the editing process. To rely on "editing at the spike" as the only or main method implies that no--or at least less--attention will be give to the rest of the file. 

The potential effectiveness of this method, of course, is predicated on realizing that you've made an error at the time you've made it. My personal experience is that many (maybe half, give or take) of the errors I make are made without my noticing them while recording. These tend to be smallish mistakes like mispronunciations, transposition of words, and other similar syntax errors. In addition to spiking not being very helpful to me, I find that the interruption of flow caused by 1) noticing the error, and 2) remembering to spike it causes me to make more errors!

Again, I'm not saying that spiking is the wrong way to edit, just that it's wrong for me. Whatever works for others, works...and more power to them!

Oh, and just to keep on the subject here... I haven't crunched any numbers, but a 3:1 ratio of recording time + editing to actuial audio seems about right. Unless my dogs (Mastiffs!) are snoring, of course, then it can be much higher - and, if you count the occasional cussing jag, much much higher.

EDIT: Does pounding on the desk afther the umpteenth re-read count as "spiking"? If so...
