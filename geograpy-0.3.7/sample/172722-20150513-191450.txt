If it's still not loud enough you'll need to tell me what to try next!As the volume was 85.7 dB, and we were aiming for 89 dB (in range 87-91 dB) so you could amplify not like Audacity said (it usually says to amplify the way the recording will be between -1 and 1 without clipping and not like in the picture here). You could amplify only by 3-4 dB.    Also there is the other way to make volume louder - to Normalize.Anyway, PL OK! Good job
