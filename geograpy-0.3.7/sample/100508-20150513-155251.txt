Thanks for listening to all these so quickly! (I had to look up the pronunciation of Ypres - and its location! I thought it was in France until I was recording, then when I realised it was in Belgium I had a small panic attack that I was saying it wrong! But according to forvo that's how to say it. I figure the good Dr is a French speaker so if he says it "Frenchly" that's probably close enough!)And yes, I'm absolutely exhausted after midnight church last night, so I'm off to bed now - but I wanted to get a chapter up today. I am determined to get this whole book done by ANZAC day!
