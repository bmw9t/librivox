Am going back to my trusty Sound Studio, and hope to heck it will be a mega ton faster.that said. I can record at 32Khz in sound Studio if you'd like that. otherwise I will default to 44.1. Just let me know.Thanks for your patience!!!!!Christie, who's still in Purgatory, but with an eye on Paradise.
Christie, you poor thing. I feel with you. I've had some GB problems and just went back to Audacity. But Sound Studio is supposed to be very good anyway, no? I know Kara uses and likes it. - 44.1 is just fine.
If you just want to record and send me the file to find an editor, that's also just fine. :)
