Welcome, Elsa!  Since we can only record things that were published before 1923, a lot of the possible science books are outdated -- but I'll bet you can find *something* that interests you!  Have a look through http://gutenberg.org .  Nearly everything there is fair game.

We welcome alternate versions of everything, so don't worry if your favorite is already in our catalog.

Of course, you'll want to contribute to a few collaborative books to get an idea of how much work is involved in recording before you start a big old scientific solo ;-)

And do submit a quick test recording (not an audition!) so we can help you check your technical settings.  http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/1-Minute_Test

Have fun!
