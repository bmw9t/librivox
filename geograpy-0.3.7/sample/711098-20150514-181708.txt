Well I was sure until just now.  I know that it was one of my first five posts, before I'd even done a recording.  I know that the post was deleted, because I can no longer find it under "View All Posts by LeonMire."  And I know that it was a work of Christian apologetics, because otherwise it wouldn't make sense.  It was a solo work, because the MC who responded to me said that it was their project, and that their summary could have their opinion in it.  

I strongly remember looking up G.K. Chesterton's "Orthodoxy" and reading some of it to find out more about the book, before I posted here.  And even the name "Pleonic" sounds right, because it has my name in it.

Pleonic, do you have any memory of this, or have I lost my mind?
