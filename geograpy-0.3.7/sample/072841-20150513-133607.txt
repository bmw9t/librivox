I hope this 1860 treaty is a worthy addition to this year's collection of short works. It is prose of the most pompous kind, being an international treaty, but its interest lies in its historical significance. Let me know if there are any problems with having this kind of text in the LV catalogue.URL for the mp3 file: https://librivox.org/uploads/hokuspokus/msw013_traitedeturindu24mars1860_various_bm_128kb.mp3Duration of recording: 07:07URL for online text: http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k960724/f44.imageTitle of work: TraitÃ© de Turin du 24 mars 1860Date of publication: 1860Name of author: variousBirth date and date of death of author: none (international treaty > PD)URL for author information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_TurinBrief indication of the work in a few words: prose, non-fiction, history, treaty, France, ItalyLanguage: French
