Thank you Maria, thank you Son. Quote:For my third and final wish (Now where did I put that lamp?), I would like to record a prose piece ... the fifteenth chapter of A. B. ‘Banjo’ Paterson’s “Happy Dispatches”, the one entitled “Hellfire Jack”. http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks06/0603451h.html#15Unfortunately this was published in 1934 outside the US, and as such, although it is PD in Australia and just about everywhere else, it is still in copyright in the US, where all our files are stored, so I'm afraid it can't be recorded for LibriVox .It occurs to me, however, that the original articles may be available at the splendid National Library of Australia Trove site.I found these articles:Making an Army: A Look Round the CampsHow Our Soldier Lads Break the MonotonyThe First Force: End of the VoyageGive It NowThe Transports.
