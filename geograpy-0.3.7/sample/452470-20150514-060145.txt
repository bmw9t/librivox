  Hi Sharon:I have just completed Chapter 04 of The Adventures of England and the URL and time is:Upload successful. URL: http://upload.librivox.org/share/uploads/ehl/adventuresofengland_04_laut.mp326:33I would like to claim Chapter 06, if it is not already spoken for? I personally have been up to Moosenee and at Moose Factory in the Hudson Bay area a couple of years ago and have photograph the site. The site is in poor shape and should be restored. There are a lot of older buildings, but could be made more interesting. The Hudson Bay Company has recently been purchased by a USA company and they do not seem interested in restoration of a very important area. The Cree Indians are still there and the only access is by train, as there are no roads, or by plane from Quebec. Please check as I do not want to start another chapter unless the titling is correct.Jules
