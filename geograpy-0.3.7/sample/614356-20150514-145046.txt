Hi rantoniomg - I'm afraid that the links are faulty, but your section is Bk 7, Ch. 02, and is headed 'Modern Mexico, Settlement of the Country, Condition of the Natives' etc. I'll check out the 'Conclusion/Subsequent Career' 

[five minutes later] I've checked it out -all the chapters are there -the chapters headings are the guide to use.
