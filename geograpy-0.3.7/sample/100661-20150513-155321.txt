Thanks, Elizabby!  Really appreciate your feedback.  I will have a go at removing the whine, though my first try just removed it from the silent bits -- it still popped up during the speaking bits and seemed to be more annoying that way.  I'll have another go at it this weekend and see if I can do better.
