I would like to read Section 41 - A Director of the bank. (I'm assuming their lines are the ones for DEPUTATION.)Could I also please read Section 32 - A Waiter and Section 82 - Power.EDIT: And it looks like the rule of shorter term applies, so could I take Section 49 - The Crone-Motive as well please.
