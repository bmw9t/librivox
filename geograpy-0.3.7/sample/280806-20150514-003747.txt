I even offer a service called "What Would Phil Do?" where you upload a short recording or piece of one that is troublesome and I make a video showing what I would do with it.   This is strictly for learning purposes and can be fun.   A few people have tried this and said they enjoyed watching someone else (me) do stuff with their track.   Others have reported severe emotional scarring ...  Hey Phil,At this point in time I don't think i could get any more scaring. Let's do it. There is already a piece of the offending audio on one of my threads, but you will have to ask Ruthie how to get there so you can play with it. can't wait to see it. To TriciaG...Thanks for the understanding.
