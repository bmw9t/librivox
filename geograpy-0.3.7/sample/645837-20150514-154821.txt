Hello there,

I have a question. I'm working on chapter 11 at the moment and Houdini in a section of it talks quite a lot about weights, - for example: 
"If the man's body weighs 150 lib. that added to 125 lib. makes the whole weight lifted by him 275 lib." and so on.
Is lib. short four pounds, the same as lb in English, which I take it for?
Should it be read "lib" ot "pounds" then to be best understood?

This is a tricky chapter I'd say, with the descriptions of the non existing illustrations of how the strong men placed or should have placed ropes and weights to ease the efforts. But still, it is interesting.
