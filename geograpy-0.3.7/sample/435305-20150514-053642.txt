Hello, naomi_jw. Thanks for volunteering. 

Normally, we don't direct people on how to deliver their lines, but Madame Pace is a special case. As it says in the play, she speaks with thick accent, half-Italian and half-Spanish, and other characters refer to it, so if you could try to do that it would be wonderful. 

Yes, the UK recognizes the rule of the shorter term. If you ever have any questions about copyright, I've found the LibriVox wiki is very good about answering them.

Also, you might want to submit a test recording to the Listeners and Editors wanted forum, so that people can make sure that the technical specs are correct and the reading is audible. The technical specs and the "1-Minute Test" are both at the LibriVox wiki too. It's always easier to submit more 1-minute tests than re-record whole sections.

As far as the remaining roles, every one except for the Juvenile Lead could be played by women, so just let me know which specific one you'd like to play and I'll add it to the Magic Window too.

Since you're new here, you should let me know which name you'd like to be assigned in the catalogue. In the interim, I've just made your catalogue name your forum nickname. Also, if you have a personal URL to a webpage or blog, I can make sure it's linked from your LibriVox page.
