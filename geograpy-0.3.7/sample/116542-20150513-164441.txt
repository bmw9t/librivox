I'm still trying to work out various voices I could use for the multiple characters in this.  Perhaps we should do this one as a DRAMATIC story with multiple voice actors.Mind you - since we are both new, we would both be stretched!! Nothing like a bit of stretch and grow though - it's good for us. This is a steep learning curve for me too!!  But "You never know unless you give it a go!"Be blessed. We have the play Blue Bird. But it would be great if someone will take this book to create dramatic reading project.
