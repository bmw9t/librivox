Praise for knotyouraveragejo (J. M. Smallheer) via the 'Thank a reader' feature:Quote:I wanted to send a little thank-you to J.M. Smallheer for all of the recordings! I love audiobooks, and have ever since I listened to the Harry Potter series when I was younger. I love to read, but I get car sick and I have a hard time falling asleep at night so they're a great way to read books and relax. I spent half of last year working as a custodian to pay for my dream semester study abroad, and listening to audiobooks kept me from going insane. I kid you not. One of my favorite books (and readers) was The House of a Thousand Candles, which I stumbled upon by pure accident. Fast forward several months and several hundred thousand miles (I managed to come up with the money for my study abroad in the Holy Land), and I found myself struggling to fall asleep what with my finals and other stressors, so I sought another mystery to sink my teeth into and downloaded The Eye of Osiris. Imagine my delight when I recognized the voice! I loved the book and was happy to hear a voice that reminded me of all the hard work I put in (and books I listened to along the way) to get where I am, and quelled the homesickness. I wanted to say shukran and toda raba (thank you) for bothering to spend all that time reading these books. You are very much appreciated!Aloha, SavannaThe House of a Thousand CandlesThe Eye of OsirisAll of Jo's recordings
