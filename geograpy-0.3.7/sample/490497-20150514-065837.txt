Excellent, Thanks "icequeen"   .  Your forum name is quite intimidating, must say...brrrr. hehe . But yes, I've done a lot of reading of fiction, non-fiction, etc, but these "history + non-fiction + personal" readings in the form of VERY formal (amazing people actually wrote like that ,eh?) letters is immensely fascinating.
