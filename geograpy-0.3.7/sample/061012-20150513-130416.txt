Or maybe you could sing it and upload a file for me to listen to?https://librivox.org/uploads/dlolso21/benhur_tirzah_2-06.mp3I was leaving it up to whoever took that part to decide whether they wanted to sing it and if they wanted to make up a tune.  I think it sounds fine! If you'd rather I'll use the read version but I like how you sang it. PL OK!
