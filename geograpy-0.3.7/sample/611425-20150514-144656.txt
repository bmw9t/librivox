Great, thank you so much, Elli!  I will probably take you up on that when I start a new solo.  I don't know if you are interested in PLing dramatic works, but I just started up a group recording of August Strindberg's "Countess Julie" that needs a DPL.  Don't feel obligated; just wanted to mention it.
