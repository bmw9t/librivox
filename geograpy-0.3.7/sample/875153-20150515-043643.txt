Greetings and welcome LibriVox,

I have listened to half of the Father Brown recordings (64 Kbps files).  
After seeing your message, I listened again carefully to parts of
Chapter 1.  I hear no (obvious) pops or clicks.  I'm thinking of the
sorts of artifacts one heard in MP3 files due to problems in
extracting (ripping) tracks from music CDs.  What I do hear in these
recordings is some background hiss, and they sound a bit raspy, too;
I associate this with the recording set-up, not the encoding step.

So, I wonder if what you hear could be due to defects introduced by a
problem in downloading the files.  Have you tried getting one of the
files another time?  Or checked another chapter of the series?

I have a lot of experience with encoding audio into MP3, and I've never
heard of encoding causing clicks and pops.  It's extracting which does that,
especially when the ripper software isn't very good.
