Katdad,It's been a real pleasure for me. Learning about this period of my own place's history, through the biased and Wildean bile of Macaulay has been a real delight. History has previously bored the socks offa me. This was definitely a changer. Wish I'd done Macaulay at school. He's hilariously bitchy and transparently mean when William's enemies hove-to. I have to try quite hard at times to stop laughing out loud as I'm reading:)Thanksbrendan
