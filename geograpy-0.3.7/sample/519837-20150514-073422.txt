Did you change the links or targets for Chapters 7 and 8? After your latest message, I re-downloaded them, and they're both complete, including their End of Chapter messages.

Which means everything I mentioned for Chapters 1 through 17 is now fixed, save the tiny Chapter 5 mistake about the bust of Homer sitting up 'only' the pedestal  .
