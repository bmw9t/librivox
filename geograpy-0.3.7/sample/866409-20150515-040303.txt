Ok I took this very seriously. I imported all the clips to Audacity and looked at the waveforms. No 1 is out. Too much background noise and that annoying blip. 

#1 too much background noise.

#2 the blip is there in the wave form but not as noticeable in the recording though I could hear it.

#3 is clean clear recording but too soft.

#4 very clean recording with a little more depth I thought. The blip is in the wave form though ever so slightly and not at all detectable in the recording. This to me is the superiour recording.
