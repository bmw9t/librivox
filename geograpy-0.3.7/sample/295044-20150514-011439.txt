Phil,I watched your video (and a few others), went back to my Audacity project file as you suggested, adjusted the settings and re-ran noise reduction.  Here is a link to that new file: http://upload.librivox.org/share/uploads/phi/pipefuls_25_morley.mp3I also wanted to remind you that I uploaded 26 a couple of nights ago.  Of course I ran noise reduction on that file before I saw your video so please let me know if I need to re-run that file as well.I want to finish the other two chapters (23 and 24) as soon as I can but will wait until you give me the okay to go ahead.Thanks!Greg
