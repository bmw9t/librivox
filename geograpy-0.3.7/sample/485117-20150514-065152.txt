Hi mikeawmids! Welcome to LibriVox. I've signed you up for Chapter 3. Here's some additional information you'll need to know and links to follow: 

Please let me know under which name or pseudonym you'd like to appear in the LibriVox catalog. This can be your screenname, your real name, or whatever name you would like.  We can also link to a personal web site/blog.
Also, as this is your first recording, we ask that you send in a test recording. This is not an audition, it's just to make sure the sound quality and the recording settings are all right - often things can be improved at the outset that are difficult to fix later. Please go to this wiki page to find out what to record for your test, and where to upload the recording.

Thanks, and have fun!
