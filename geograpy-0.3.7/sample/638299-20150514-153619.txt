 ...[checks window]...looks like you've got it.

Since this is your first recording for LibriVox, I'd like you to upload a test recording so that we can get all of the technical specs checked out in your setup. This is so that you don't record the whole section and then find out that "Oh, no, there's a horrible background buzz in my recording, I'm going to have to re-do it all over again!" sort of thing. The test can either be the short "Peter Piper picked a couple of pages..." ditty from the How to Record wiki page, or it can be the intro and first paragraph or so of your story. In either case, please upload it to the uploader (instructions are in the first post of this thread) and post the link in a new reply here.

Also, I'll need to know what name or pseudonym you want to be credited under in the catalog. That can be your forum name, your full name, your first initial and last name, or whatever you want to appear on the catalog page when the project is complete. We can also link to a web page or blog if you'd like, but that is entirely optional.
