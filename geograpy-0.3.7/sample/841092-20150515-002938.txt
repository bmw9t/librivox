I just finished my first recording, here's what I learned:

1-don't stop the recording to take a drink or a breath, just pause it
2-dont stop the recording when you make a mistake, just start the sentence over and edit out the mistake later
3-keep the mic to the side of your mouth to avoid plosives
4-read the selection out loud before attempting to record it
5-listen to the sounds around you and eliminate as many as possible no matter how faint they are, I turned off the humidifier - it made a HUGE difference
6-speak slowly, but I knew this one after listening to some chapters from Sense and Sensibility that sounded like a reading race was taking place
