I realize the Dramatic Works forum is quite full right now, so I'm not proposing to start any of these immediately, but I wanted to let folks know that I would like to BC the following plays by Euripides at some point:Hippolytus (trans. Gilbert Murray) [DONE]http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8418Fourteen roles: Aphrodite, Theseus, Phaedra, Hippolytus, Nurse, Henchman, Artemis, Old Huntsman, male and female Chorus, NarratorAlcestis (trans. Gilbert Murray) [DONE]http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10523Fourteen roles: Admetus, Alcestis, Pheres, Little Boy, Manservant, Handmaid, Heracles, Apollo, Thanatos, Chorus (male and female), NarratorElectra by Euripides (trans. Gilbert Murray)http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14322Twelve roles: Clytemnestra, Electra, Orestes, Peasant, Old Man, Messenger, Castor, Chorus (female), NarratorIphigenia in Aulis (trans. Theodore Buckley) [DONE]http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15081Thirteen roles: Agamemnon, Old Man, Menelaus, Achilles, Messenger, Another Messenger, Iphigenia, Clytemnestra, Chorus (male), NarratorUnfortunately the Gilbert Murray translations are not PD 70 - Murray died in 1957 - but his translations are the best on Gutenberg in my opinion. (The Buckley translation is PD for everyone, though.)I'd be interested to hear if anyone is interested in one or more of these in particular, so please feel free to post and/or PM me.
