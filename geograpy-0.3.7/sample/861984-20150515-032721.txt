We discussed Metamorphoses translations a page or two back in this thread, and I found several on-line options.Leni wrote:I'd be willing to contribute though if someone decides to coordinate a project on Caesar, Juvenal, Petronius (I don't know if anyone has suggested the Satyricon?), Horace (I noticed there are two poems in Short Poetry Collections already, but maybe the Carmen Saeculare?) and so on.I like all of these - so many books, so little time!Leni wrote:Regarding the recording of Latin text in Latin - as to the pronunciation, I imagine it's been a much debated issue already, and I've been hearing some of the Eclogues... and I couldn't very well understand what the guidelines are. So... I could probably read poetry in Latin, but I'd need some help as to what's expected in terms of pronunciation.
Because of the variety of pronunciations, I think I'd prefer original Latin and Greek readings to be done by a few soloists cooperating together by prior plan: a duet or trio, etc.

I realize our offerings are skewed to history, which is my own "hobby".
As we attract more readers, I hope we can open additional book projects.  And as those we have finish up, I will be reviewing this thread to see what had been suggested.
