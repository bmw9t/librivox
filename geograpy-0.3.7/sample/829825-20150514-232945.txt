Could I have some suggestions for pronunciation from this poem by Longfellow, please?

Heraldic:

He beareth gules upon his shield,
  A chevron argent in the field,
  With three wolf's heads, and for the crest
  A Wyvern part-per-pale addressed

Places and people:

Fiesole's green hills and vales
  Remembered for Boccaccio's sake.

 The songs of the Sicilian muse,--
  Bucolic songs by Meli sung

 That meet the mariner, who sails
  Through the Moluccas, and the seas
  That wash the shores of Celebes.

Old ballads, and wild melodies
  Through mist and darkness pouring forth,
  Like Elivagar's river flowing      [possibly Norway?]
  Out of the glaciers of the North.
