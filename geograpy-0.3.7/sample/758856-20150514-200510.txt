Rachel,

Even though it's in the FAQ, I found that reposting the following in the opening post or thread seemed to help:

For what type of errors should I be listening?

Please listen for passages that the reader repeated that they likely intended to edit out after they re-read the portion. Also, please note any long pauses that you find disrupt the flow of your listening pleasure. It is NOT necessary for you to follow along with the text; just listen as you would normally.

For what types of errors should I NOT be listening?

Text content, reading style, speed, pronunciation, or accents. The LibriVox community values a wide variety of reading styles; what one person finds difficult to hear, another person may really enjoy. The interpretation of the reader is not for our proof-listeners to judge. If you are uncomfortable listening to a particular voice, feel free to return the section to the pool for another proof-listener to claim. 

Hope this helps, ttm
