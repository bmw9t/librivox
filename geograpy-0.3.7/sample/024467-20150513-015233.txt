Judging by the fact that you posted before I went to bed, and when I got up no-one had answered you, the best advice I could give would be to choose a new user name. 

Other than that, I recommend reading the Newbie Guide to Recording and doing a short test recording to make sure that all your settings are OK. 

Then the world is your oyster - all the readers wanted forums are looking for readers.
