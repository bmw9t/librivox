Kristin,Hope things are looking up for you.  Your post has sparked a wonderful list of books!  I'm going to check out several that I had not heard of before.Personally, I thought Elizabeth Klett's recording of Pride and Prejudice was terrific at bringing out the biting humor of Austen.  But it may not be everyone's cup of tea.    And for light listening - I have enjoyedThe Adventures of Sally - http://librivox.org/the-adventures-of-sally-by-p-g-wodehouse/The Girl on the Boat - http://librivox.org/the-girl-on-the-boat-by-p-g-wodehouse/Heidi - http://librivox.org/heidi-by-johanna-spyri-solo/Oh, that's a little tilted toward KayRay.  So for some variety, I would second the Zenda stories read by Andy Minter and add:Some Experiences of an Irish PM http://librivox.org/some-experiences-of-an-irish-rm-by-edith-oenone-somerville-and-martin-ross/MaryAnn
