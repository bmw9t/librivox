I had some time after all. Len - PL OK!Tracie - your ID tag has "The Old Roller Tower" instead of "Towel." Also, you have a few plosives (where your breath hits the mic and causes a popping or strong wind sound). Try moving your microphone to the side (if a stand mic) or above/below your mouth (if a headset mic) a little more so that your breath is less likely to hit the mic.Your recording is borderline on the quiet side. You could try upping your input volume a little more, or if you've already done that, you can do a leveler or amplify effect on the entire file ("Amplify" will do a straight volume-up; "Leveler" will increase the quieter parts while not increasing the louder ones, making a more level volume).Would you mind trying it again with these changes? Fortunately it's a short poem.
