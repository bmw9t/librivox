Hi Ed, I'm sorry to hear that there are still problems with uploading. Could you upload your file at http://ge.tt/ and send me the resulting link to it via pm? I'll have a look and try it from my end here. The combination Windows 8 and Internet Explorer was an issue according to the 'Uploader help topic'. If you like you can send me your system/setup information with these parameters via pm. I'll be restricted to cell-phone-internet-only again starting in six hours. Functions are very limited for me in that time.  (   Note to self: Should get a new phone.) Will be back in full function mode in 24 hours. But I can read and answer posts and PMs.Greetings, Kajo
