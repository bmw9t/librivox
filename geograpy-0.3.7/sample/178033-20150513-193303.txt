I usually check iTranslate if I have a word that is questionable and it supports my pronunciation.  Although not a nautical guy myself I have read a story or two and this version has always passed.  If you prefer I will change it since I want your project done right.  Please advise.Thanks again!GregI think this is a difference between English and American pronunciation and either is acceptable. Thanks guys...Lynne
