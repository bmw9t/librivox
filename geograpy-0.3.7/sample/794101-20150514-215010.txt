There are new or updated plain vanilla CD case insert(s) for:A Fair Barbarian,   http://librivox.org/fair-barbarian-a-by-frances-hodgson-burnett/I Will Repay,   http://librivox.org/i-will-repay-by-baroness-orczy/The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes (Version 2),   http://librivox.org/the-adventures-of-sherlock-holmes-by-sir-arthur-conan-doyle/The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes (Version 3),   http://librivox.org/the-adventures-of-sherlock-holmes-by-sir-arthur-conan-doyle-2/     (Note: LibriVox has three versions of "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes". The catalog search, https://catalog.librivox.org/search.php?title=the+adventures+of+sherlock+holmes&author=&status=all&action=Search , mentions the version information, but each catalog pages doesn't. When an admin has a free moment, and the urge, they might wish to consider adding the version to the catalog pages. Just a suggestion. R.)The Time Machine (Version 2),   http://librivox.org/the-time-machine-version-2-by-h-g-wells/     (Similarly to above, for the three versions of "The Time Machine". The catalog search https://catalog.librivox.org/search.php?title=the+time+machine&author=&status=all&action=Search shows versions, but each catalog page doesn't.
