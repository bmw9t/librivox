Or if not in every case, you can just let me know if you wish the reading to stand as is.I will listen to Section 2 this evening.Have a great day! Hi Lucretia,Yes the Google scan will be our foundation and always considered correct, unless there's a clear and obvious typo or grammatical error in the original that we can go ahead and correct. We have to be somewhat careful with Twain, though, because he often uses colloquial and right-for-the-time language and spellings which we want to preserve!it's sometimes a matter of discussion!I'll make your corrections tomorrow and keep plugging away after that. Thanks for your notes!!-j
