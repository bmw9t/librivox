Luckily it passed about 30 miles south of us or so and then went east, but people were unfortunately killed as close by as that.  For a while it looked like it was going to come right towards us. We just found out tonight that a cousin's friend completely lost their house - thankfully the family is fine - they rode it out in the basement.  Not a fun afternoon...
