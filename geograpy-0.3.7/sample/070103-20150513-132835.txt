Hi SeamusD, I would love for you to read Khlestakov.Please read your voice credit exactly is it is given in the Magic Window - Ivan Aleksandrovich Khlestakov, an official from St. Petersburg, read by [Your Name].If you need help with the pronunciation of any of the names, there is a pronunciation guide linked below the MW.Some tips, since this is your first dramatic reading: Please leave a few seconds (3 to 5) between each of your lines, to make editing easier. Do the same with any stage directions that occur in the middle of a speech - leave a pause so I can drop them into place.There's no need to rush, as I still haven't finished editing the stage directions, and I have some corrections to record.Enjoy!
