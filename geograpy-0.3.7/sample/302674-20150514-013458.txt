There are a lot of them.I'll have to get back to you, Tricia. The tables do not seem so straightforward.Cheers,Carl.I was thinking the same thing Tricia was - but luckily, she beat me to it....    The tables are actually quite straightforward, if you read them down instead of across - and they'd make a great addition to the Insomnia Collection.....Patti
