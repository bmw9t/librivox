Sorry for the delay - here are some PL notes for Anna:Some of your files are a little quiet. Could you amplify sections 28 and 30 by 3dB and 31 by 2db? (29 comes in at 87,7dB which I think is fine!)Section 28 has a bit of a whistly noise at 15:12 which you could also try cleaning up if you want, though it's no biggie if not. Section 29 has what I think are bird noises at 4:07, but again they're very minor. Section 30 is PL OK (apart from the quietness).Feel free to wait for the last of the files to be PLed before editing/reuploading. Petra
