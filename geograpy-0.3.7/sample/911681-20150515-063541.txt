by fluke I was attending this conference when the announcement was made:
http://opencontentalliance.org

an event for libraries etc dedicated to scanning books, but not so hot on allowing google to control access to all human knowledge for strictly commercial purposes.

It was pretty interesting to be involved in the discussions, tho i'll have to ponder a bit more before I write any of my specific thoughts. 

But here is a nice nugget: 
-libraries that gave google access to their books to scan will have to pay google a subscription fee to get access to their books in digital.
