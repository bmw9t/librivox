When PLing I usually note what I would have changed if it were my recording, but the reader also has a say, especially in suggestions that are trivial and might not be worth the editing.  So, Section 17 and 18 are  PL OK   and I have a small note for Section 21:at around 01:28, text "since the airplane will decelerate rapidly and may approach the critical angle of attack and stall.", recorded as "since the airplane will decelerate rapidly and may not approach the critical angle of attack and stall."
