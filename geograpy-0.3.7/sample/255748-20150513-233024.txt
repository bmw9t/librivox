Here are some PL notes for the sections 00, 04 and 05.#00:Very good reading, Pamela!   It is PL OK beside one tiny thing I stumbled across: a strange 'word' at 3:09 in one of the book titles. Maybe caused by an OCR error in the source file. The title of the book is 'National Encyclopedia of American Biography'. It is very easily editable by using one of the other 'of' instances from the other titles to replace it. #04 and #05:Good reading, tekksavvy318!   Here are my PL notes for your sections.#04: File name (already mentioned by John): is 'lifeadventures…', should be 'lifeandventures…'.ID3 tag for title: is '04', should be '04 - [section title]'.Stumble at 3:29 before 'brother'.Repeat starting at 5:18 'The old pastor had … among his parishioners.' Stumble at 5:12 before 'for years'.Volume: varies greatly between the first and the second part of the recording. It is suddenly much louder starting from 5:26. Ending silence: is half a second, should be 5 seconds long.#05: File name (already mentioned by John): is 'lifeadventures…', should be 'lifeandventures…'.ID3 tag for title: is '05', should be '05 - [section title]'.Repeat at 0:26 'Chapter V' (I would recommend to cut out the first appearance from 0:24 – 0:25).At 04:09 is a sentence that is cut off in the middle '… for the phenom-'.Ending silence: is one second, should be 5 seconds long.Greetings Kajo
