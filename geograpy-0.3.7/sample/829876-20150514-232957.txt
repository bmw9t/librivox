It looks to me a lot like a book review / information aggregation site -- I clicked through to the only thing I could find that was public domain (and that's in the UK, I know it's copyright in the US) and there were no download links, just some reviews stolen from Amazon.  (i.e. they don't acknowledge that source.)  Info about another book came from barnesandnoble.com.

Not okay, IMO.
