Well, everyone is entitled to their feelings, and entitled to express those feelings. I think Ruthie may be talking in a broader, life experience sense. Just because an opinion is expressed, does not mean it is directly aimed at "Librivox". The people here have other lives separate from this, and I would hope that personal expression would not be misconstrued as some vague criticism of someone involved in only one aspect of a varied life. I feel very uncomfortable with the occasional atmosphere of "Librivoxism", where personal comments are not welcomed. I really wish an atmosphere of general acceptance would apply to people's feelings as much as to their reading ability. Tara
