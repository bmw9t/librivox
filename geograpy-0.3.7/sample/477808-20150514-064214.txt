In fact, I'd read it to anyone who would listen! I know it's a hugely presumptuous imposition on my part, since you already claimed it, but would it possibly be permissible for me to read that chapter?If not, I also love chapters 19 and 21 for their understated ironic language. In other words, they're FUNNY!As goes distinguishing my voice from that of the Yellow Hen, that shouldn't be any problem. Mine is a distinctive and mellifluous voice of a singer, while the voice I've always heard in my mind's eye (mind's ear?) for Billina is... well... chickeny!

Well, I suppose since you're so exuberant! That's one of my favorite chapters too, but I'll do another!
