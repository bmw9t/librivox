Welcome Jack 23 is all yours! It would be a good idea for you to submit a little test. This is not an audition, but just a way to check that your settings are all good. Here are Phil's wonderful videos, to help you get started.Let me know if you need help. Please post your test in the Listeners and Editors Wanted forum, you'll get faster feedback (I won't be able to listen before another couple of days).
