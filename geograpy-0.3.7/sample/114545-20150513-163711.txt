Here's Section 24 -- (Part II Chapter 4: Congressoinal Legislation for the Protection of the Bison) -- (length 27:09)https://librivox.org/uploads/icequeen/exterminationamericanbison_24_hornaday_128kb.mp3I've gotta say, the running account of who-said-what in the congressional debate in this chapter began to sound like a comic satire after a page or two!(BTW, I just noticed, when I copy/pasted the name of the section from the MW, that "Congressional" is "Congressoinal").
