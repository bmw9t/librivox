Quote:because their copyright wasn't renewed within 26 (or is it 28? Now I don't remember) years of the original publication date.In the US, books and periodicals published before 1964 had to get their copyrights renewed in their 28th year, or they'd fall into the public domain. And short-lived pulp magazines were particularly bad at renewing copyright, often because they had gone out of business by then. However, as Tricia says, we have to rely on Gutenberg, because we have no access to copyright lawyers ourselves, and magazine contribution renewals are particularly hard to track down. In the early 1960s, fewer than 15% of all registered copyrights were renewed, apparently, and for books, the figure was even lower at 7%. However:As the US Copyright Office, in 2004, wrote:There are several ways to investigate whether a work is under copyright protection and, if so, the facts of the copyright. These are the main ones:1 Examine a copy of the work for such elements as a copyright notice, place and date of publication, author and publisher. 2 Search the Copyright Office catalogs and other records.3 Have the Copyright Office conduct a search for you.A Few Words of Caution About Copyright InvestigationsCopyright investigations often involve more than one of these methods. Even if you follow all three approaches, the results may not be conclusive. Moreover, as explained in this circular, the changes brought about under the Copyright Act of 1976, the Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988, the Copyright Renewal Act of 1992, and the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998 must be considered when investigating the copyright status of a work.Ruth
