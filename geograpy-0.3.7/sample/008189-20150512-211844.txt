Hello Nazim san, Welcome to LibriVox. I hope you enjoy it here. Everybody is not good at first. So I suppose you'll soon be good at reading. Your next step is 1 minute test. This is a 30 second recording. Save it in mp3 and upload it. Then please post to Listeners & Editors Wanted. After one minute test you start your recording. My recommendation is weekly poety. I wonder if you can also record for Multilingual Short Works Collection 005 in your language.Cheers,Masa
