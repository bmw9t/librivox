I can see that the instructions I gave on the main page were not correct (they are the standard that I did not update correctly...Quote:Firstly, though, we need to decide how the intros should be read (making a mental note that, wherever it's not obvious, you need to tell the readers exactly what to say)...It looks like 4, 5, 7, and 9 are the way that I had intended.  6 probably would have been, but I appear to have messed up with the text there. 8 can be corrected with a simple edit.Quote:"Chirp the First, part 1, of The Cricket on the Hearth.  This is a LibriVox recording (etc) ..... The Cricket on the Hearth, by Charles Dickens.  Chirp the First, part 1."

In the future I can keep that thought in mind, but asking everyone to re-record when the instructions were mostly followed does not seem right.

Unless you have a big complaint, I will ask for 1-3 and 6 to be re-recorded to match the others and 8 can be edited.

Thanks,
