Following are my readings for the two acts in which Calymath appears, along with my credit.  It was unexpectedly challenging providing the lines with a realistic tone, without benefit of fellow actors, so I'm rather dubious about the delivery.  I sound like a character in an old Masters of the Universe cartoon, I think.  If you have any suggestions, or would like me to alter my recording levels, let me know, and I'll happily read again.
