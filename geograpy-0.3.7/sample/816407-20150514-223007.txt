Hmm ... should I have removed the noise from the wave before converting it to mp3? I'm sorry if that is a dumb question but I am very new to this.    It is my first project, in fact.  I will try what you suggested and doing the noise removal before conversion to see if either yields a better sound.Where would you like me to upload them?
