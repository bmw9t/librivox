LibriVox doesn't do the conversions; Archive.org does. They're the ones who host our cataloged files. What I'll do is a little test, uploading a file to Archive and having it derive, and seeing if the MP3Gain adjustment stays. It could be that MP3Gain has changed something, or Archive has changed something.   I'll post my findings in a separate thread, since this is getting way off the course of this specific project. I'll edit this post with a link to the new thread once I post it. It'll be a couple hours.
