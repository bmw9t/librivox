Hi Maria,

and thank you for adding a lovely reading to this collection.

The volume is extremely low, however, and will need to be boosted before we catalogue the file.  That will in turn make the background noise louder too.  

Can you look at your audio set-up and see if you can increase the input volume? If you can find where to make the adjustment, and try recording agian, you'll probably hear a significant improvement.

If you can't find the right control panel, let me know and I'll point you to some help.

David
