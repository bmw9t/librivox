Ah, now I don't have to start a thread on this!I find it very difficult to read from the computer screen.  The act of manipulating a mouse, touch pad, and following the scrolling screen AND trying to read well at the same time is just more than I can manage.  The book formats are sometimes extremely difficult to read on the screen.My preferred method is to read from my Kindle!   The problem is that not all Kindle files are properly formatted and are so full of errors that it is impossible to use them.  The same is true of the "Full Text" option for many books.  Consequently, I also have to print out some chapters and proof them before reading.When it comes to dramatic works, I always print out the portions for my role.  Then I highlight and mark my script.   Trying to follow it any other way for me is too difficult.An iPad or other tablet would be an ideal solution for many texts, too.~Larry
