Bill,After reading Tgeller's post I will do my best with the French names but I must admit I had not really thought about it until now.  I have now passed my initial poetry reading and so can get on with something else.I will let you have the first section as soon as I have completed it (give me week or so), then you can say what you think about the pronunciation.Christine
