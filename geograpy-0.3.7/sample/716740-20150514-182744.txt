Thanks for the good wishes, Maikki! Hopefully this'll be our last move for a long time, since we're finally moving into our very own house. If we do have any boxes left over in, oh, a couple of years, I'll probably throw them out. 

It will be interesting to see if there are more Finnish readers out there! In any case, I'll stick all the files I haven't done yet on my mp3 player on Thursday and then see how many I can listen to over the weekend (travelling to see boyfriend's family, because just moving house wasn't enough!).

Cheers,
A.
