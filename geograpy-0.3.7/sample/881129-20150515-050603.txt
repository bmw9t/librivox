Modern editions are indeed different from the Project Gutenberg text that I recorded. 

In the Project Gutenberg text, the last three chapters are:

CHAPTER XXIX.    Continental
CHAPTER XXX.    Snowed Up
CHAPTER XXXI.    Exeunt

I remember I looked at a modern Penguin edition to compare one or two typos in the PG text, and there was indeed a chapter called Snow. I'm not surprised that later editions split Continental  - it was a huge chapter.
