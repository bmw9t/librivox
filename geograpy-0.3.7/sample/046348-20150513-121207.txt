Welcome!The wiki, linked at the top of each forum page, has a lot of information. Specifically, the Newbie Guide to Recording is a good place to start.We do STRONGLY encourage a one-minute test (LINK) to check your technical settings. It's not an audition, but to make sure you're exporting at the correct bit rate, have your recording in mono, etc.We also recommend that you take on a section or two of a group project before embarking on a solo. As a soloist, you'd be in charge of the Magic Window and all the details to make the project. So you should be a bit familiar with the LibriVox processes. Reading in a group project is a good way to do that. Also, it gives you the chance to see how much work is involved in reading and editing a chapter. A lot of new soloists are surprised at how much more work it is than they had expected, and often drop out of their solos because of it. So please read a section or two in a group project to get the hang of it!That said, I found an online text of the Treatise here: http://www.mun.ca/rels/restmov/texts/jwmcgarvey/atote/ATOTE00.HTMIt looks like it would be OK regarding copyright/PD issues.
