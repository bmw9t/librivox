Yes, dairy is the enemy.  And that's not just milk, I find any dairy can cause those problems.  I have allergies and just hate taking anything.  Here are some things I've found helps congestion.
1)  A bowl of boiling water with a few drops of eucalyptus oil and a towl over your head.  The combination of steam and eucalyptus clears the sinuses.  (As long as you're not allergic to it.  There is a difference between pure eucalyptus oil, which I'm not allergic too and the eucalyptus scented stuff they sell in stores which I am.)  Unfortunately, this can occationally cause dripping.
2)  And since you've boiled water have a cup of Ginger Lemon tea.  Lovely.  Just eats away any phlegm.
3)  Don't vacuum or dust or shake out rugs before you plan to record.  It angers the dust mites and they will make you pay.
4)  When all else fails, I give in and take a claritin.  It's the only thing that doesn't knock me out.  Unfortunately, I find it only works for about 6-8 hours not 24.
5)  I've forgotten the other thing.  I'll add it when I remember.
6)  If you are getting a sore throat from drainage gargling with sage in warm water might help.  It has a slight numbing effect.

Oh, yeah, I also go through more than my share of herbal cough drops.  I suck on them for a little while then stick them back to the paper until I need them again.
