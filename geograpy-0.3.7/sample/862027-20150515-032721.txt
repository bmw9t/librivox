I love the Martial idea!  Ovid and Horace, though they have been requested and would be welcome offerings, are a (relatively!) straightforward matter of choosing a single translation.  It appears that Martial requires a little more research, and you have the advantage of having the experience doing that with the Scientists!

I think you should follow your interest.  We will certainly get around to Ovid, eventually.

About the sexual ones - I understand the morality of the time, but isn't it strange that it was OK to print it in the original language, or a foreign language, when it wasn't OK in English?  Try to justify it logically . . .
