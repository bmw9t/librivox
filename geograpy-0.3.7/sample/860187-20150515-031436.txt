I'm very happy you liked it, thanks Lucy! It was great fun to coordinate - and it was done very quickly too... If you liked the Kwaidan you may want to try out Hearn's Kotto too. More Japanese stories, this time also a few from his own experience... 

btw, do I detect a certain bias to your recent listening? All stuff that's on the bookclub list?
