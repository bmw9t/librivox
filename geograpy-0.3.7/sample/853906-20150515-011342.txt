We don't know yet, but we are getting there!  The most recent estimate is that the admins have done the data cleaning on just over 3000 of the cataloged pages, or about 60% of the total.  I don't know how long it will take our developer to finish his part.  We are being very optimistic that the big changeover could happen in time for LV's birthday, but I wouldn't want to make any promises. (p.s. The work done so far represents an enormous outlay of time and effort from a number of admins -- I'd say "us" but I haven't been able to help yet.  Tomorrow I start. )
