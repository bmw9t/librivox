I received a reply from mknightretke:mknightretke wrote:I'm sorry it's taken me so long to reply. School has just started up again here and I'm entering my eleventh year, so things have been a bit crazy. I don't think I'll have enough time to record the entire book myself, sadly; go ahead and add the existing recordings to the Magic Window, and I'll finish recording the next chapter as soon as I get a spare moment.Thanks so much,All the best,Matthew
