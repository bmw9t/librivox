I agree with Anne.Don't trust what is written about copyright status at Archive. They don't check the submissions, and something could be claimed as "OUT_OF_COPYRIGHT" which is only that way in Canada, but not in the US, or something like that.So yeah - if the Archive scans of the edition you're reading from says anything 1922 or earlier, you're good to go.
