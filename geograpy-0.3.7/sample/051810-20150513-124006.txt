I think moving this to the last spot and adding a comment as to the nature of the recording in the description sounds like a reasonable approach.  I'm a chemist by profession, but I probably wouldn't choose to listen to the base sequence of a genome (or the amino acid sequence of a protein, for that matter) as light entertainment, which I think is the point of these coffee break collections.  However, that's not to say there aren't lots of folks out there who would find this fascinating.  Rosie - either you or I can arrange the sections in whatever order you want before cataloging.  It's a simple matter of rearranging the rows in the section compiler by dragging and dropping them where you want them.  For example, for the nonfiction collections, I always alphabetize the submissions when I catalog the project.  Happy to discuss further if you wish.
