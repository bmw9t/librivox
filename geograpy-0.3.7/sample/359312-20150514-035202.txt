No rush Diana! Champagne for you and pizza and beer for me and Jo, and we'll celebrate the passing of your final exam (CONGRATULATIONS by the way!!!)    and the finishing of this book and the finally being able to put BCM to rest!!   Jo, there's no telling what you'll find when you get this thing in the validator. I got so focused on finishing that I didn't pay much attention to typos and what-not with the tags and obviously with the filenames.    It just hit me I HAD to finish.
